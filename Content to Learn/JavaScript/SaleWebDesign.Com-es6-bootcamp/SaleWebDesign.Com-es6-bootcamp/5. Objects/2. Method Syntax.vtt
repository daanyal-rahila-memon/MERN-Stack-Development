Another cool thing that's available inside of javascript is something referred to as concise method

00:06.210 --> 00:12.810
syntax like usual it's just a fancy name for a simple concept and that is typically whenever we make

00:12.860 --> 00:19.990
a object like for example Konst person equals and then maybe we have a name.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.670
Andrew X. That's a cool name and then we'll do a function.

00:23.670 --> 00:32.430
So would you like say a name and of course we said equal to a function inside of here we is concert

00:32.430 --> 00:33.270
or.

00:34.270 --> 00:37.050
And then we'll do a template literals.

00:38.370 --> 00:41.370
My name is don't forget you comma good grammar.

00:41.370 --> 00:42.690
My name is.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.430
I think that's good grammar substitution.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.150
This name like so.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.680
Man look how nice that is.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.850
We're so we're so modern.

00:52.860 --> 01:00.390
So with that being said there is actually another way to make a function in or a method I should say

01:00.510 --> 01:06.660
inside of this new syntax so instead of doing this what we could do I'm going to copy it essentially

01:06.780 --> 01:09.830
and show it to you put it down here.

01:09.900 --> 01:19.170
Person 2 is instead of doing all this we can just write say name parentheses and then after that I'll

01:19.170 --> 01:24.030
just copy the consulate out loud because there is no sense in copying that or writing it out again I

01:24.030 --> 01:24.700
should say.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.640
So in this case boom like that.

01:26.940 --> 01:29.260
And it does the exact same thing as before.

01:29.300 --> 01:35.220
And whenever we use concise method syntax it just means that we don't have to use a colon and we don't

01:35.220 --> 01:36.940
have to use the function keyword.

01:37.050 --> 01:42.000
So it looks a lot nicer to be honest with you and it's more similar to other programming languages that

01:42.000 --> 01:43.260
you'll run into.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.070
The only real difference here is in the case of say name.

01:47.070 --> 01:50.130
It's essentially a signed an anonymous function.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.430
And in that case that's why we can use it as a function.

01:53.430 --> 01:59.460
Aside from that whenever you use this concise method syntax you have access to the keywords super which

01:59.460 --> 02:03.620
we're going to talk about a little later when we talk about prototypes and things like that.

02:03.780 --> 02:09.330
So whenever you don't use concise method syntax you won't have access to the keywords super But if you

02:09.330 --> 02:14.820
do use this new syntax you will have access to the key word super which we'll talk about later but once

02:14.820 --> 02:16.750
again just another syntax optimizer.
