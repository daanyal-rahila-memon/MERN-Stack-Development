Now a lot of work was put into making working with the prototype much easier.

00:06.120 --> 00:13.140
One of the things that was added was a keyword called Super and in its simplest form basically it makes

00:13.140 --> 00:19.740
working with your prototype objects a lot easier and accessing their functionality just overall much

00:19.770 --> 00:20.910
facilitated.

00:20.910 --> 00:26.770
So with that being said we're going to make an example and we'll do a couple of objects here so I'll

00:26.770 --> 00:27.240
do.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.310
Person equals an object literal.

00:31.410 --> 00:33.040
And we'll do agree.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.980
And then inside of here we'll return Hello.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.360
Notice here I'm also using this concise method syntax and I'm not doing a colon with the function keyword.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.980
Just something to keep in mind.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.850
Make sure you do it this way.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.080
With that being said I'm going to copy this.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.740
I do like three of them because I don't want to really write it all out again so I'll just change this

00:52.740 --> 00:54.170
to animal and change this to.

00:54.180 --> 01:01.260
Oh and then all I am going to do is change this to friend like so and then down below.

01:01.260 --> 01:08.040
I'm going to set it some of the set the prototype of friend equal to a person so do a prototype of then

01:08.040 --> 01:14.790
I'll pass an friend in the prototype I want to set it to or connected to it.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.920
Now with that being said there is a bit of a problem let's say inside of here I want to call the method

01:22.980 --> 01:28.710
of my prototype but I've already defined a method of the same name within my friend.

01:28.710 --> 01:37.590
So in this case if I specify something like let's say hi and then below that and to cancel that log

01:38.430 --> 01:47.180
friend dog gry and then invoke the function you're going to see it says hi and of course by Calment

01:47.180 --> 01:47.970
it out.

01:48.140 --> 01:52.160
You'll see it says hello or at least it should if it remembers.

01:52.290 --> 01:57.580
But either way the reason it's doing this is because we already have this method right here.

01:57.590 --> 02:01.990
And so javascript doesn't need to go looking up the prototype chain if you will.

02:02.150 --> 02:04.070
So how can we override this.

02:04.070 --> 02:07.790
Well originally what you might have to do is something like this.

02:07.790 --> 02:20.050
You might have to do something like say object doget prototype and then this and then Daag grete and

02:20.050 --> 02:24.880
then dot call and then this right here.

02:24.880 --> 02:30.700
Now obviously this is pretty wacky but it does work and it actually prints out hello instead of what

02:30.700 --> 02:32.860
I originally defined in my function.

02:32.860 --> 02:40.540
Now I can append something to this like for example I could add a plus space there and you can see it

02:40.540 --> 02:41.500
says hello there now.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.630
So it's clearly working.

02:43.630 --> 02:50.500
Essentially what's happening is I'm calling object prototype of this to make sure that I'm getting the

02:50.500 --> 02:57.580
correct prototype and then I invoke gry but I use it with a call and then I pass in this and that's

02:57.580 --> 03:03.150
just to make sure that the keyword this inside of the prototype method is set correctly.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.950
Now this is not exactly great.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.870
It has its limitations.

03:07.870 --> 03:12.260
And honestly it's just a lot of work it's pretty it's pretty intense here.

03:12.280 --> 03:17.300
So instead what we could do is we could just use the super keyword.

03:17.320 --> 03:17.860
That's right.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.000
That's all you have to do.

03:19.180 --> 03:25.900
So I'm going to comment out this and I'm going to do old slash hard way.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.810
And then after that I'm going to do something else when I return.

03:29.980 --> 03:39.000
And I'm just going to do super and then greet like that just like that and then I'll add there and does

03:39.000 --> 03:44.060
the same exact thing as you can see it does the same exact thing as it did before right here.

03:44.190 --> 03:50.790
So this super is allowing me to very easily interface with my prototype without having to do all of

03:50.790 --> 03:51.240
this.
