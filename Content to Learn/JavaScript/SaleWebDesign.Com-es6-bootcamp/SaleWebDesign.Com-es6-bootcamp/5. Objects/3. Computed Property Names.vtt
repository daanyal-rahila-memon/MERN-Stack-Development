IOS 6 also allows you to create what are called computed property names so I'll give you an example.

00:06.480 --> 00:12.810
Let's say we have a person will do Konst person equals that inside of here we might have something like

00:12.840 --> 00:13.990
first.

00:14.780 --> 00:22.170
And then after that we can put in a Z chiel I should have picked something easier to spell lists just

00:22.170 --> 00:24.260
do Zach SEC takling.

00:24.270 --> 00:27.210
So now this works pretty well.

00:27.240 --> 00:33.900
And in order to access this it would be pretty easy inside of our consulate or a log that we'll make.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.320
We would just have to use brackets notation right.

00:36.540 --> 00:42.510
So just do person brackets and then pass in a string like so.

00:42.590 --> 00:43.740
And this works out pretty well.

00:43.770 --> 00:49.860
Prince Zach and we could also assign things by creating computed values so we might create a variable

00:49.860 --> 01:01.000
like so we'll do let's say let in and second name equals and then we'll do a second name like so.

01:01.340 --> 01:08.700
And this would allow us to basically create another variable or another property.

01:08.700 --> 01:17.670
I should say on our object Zack attack like so now if I can log my person object you'll see I've made

01:17.670 --> 01:22.500
a modification to it and now it has a property on it called second name.

01:22.530 --> 01:28.980
So this is pretty good and we can use this different variables in different evaluations of those variables

01:28.980 --> 01:30.510
to access our properties.

01:30.510 --> 01:37.490
So now I could do like first name set it equal to the string right here.

01:37.500 --> 01:44.240
So I'll just copy this and then I can use brackets notation to even access that particular thing.

01:44.240 --> 01:49.720
So your first name like so and it prints out Zack again.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.420
So this works out pretty well.

01:51.430 --> 01:58.420
However there is a limitation we cannot use computed values inside of our object literal syntax.

01:58.420 --> 02:04.780
So in other words before Year 6 if I tried to do something like reference this variable like second

02:04.780 --> 02:07.780
name it wouldn't work out very well.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.370
It would think that I'm trying to give it a regular property name inside of six.

02:12.370 --> 02:20.470
However I can actually use variables and make calculations like so for example I could do.

02:20.550 --> 02:23.640
I'm going to move this up top because right now it's in the TTC.

02:23.930 --> 02:25.680
So move that above.

02:25.710 --> 02:34.440
So all I have to do is add brackets in and second name like so and then set this equal to attack and

02:34.450 --> 02:44.280
then I can just comment this out right here and I might change this to let's say last name or a second

02:44.280 --> 02:47.080
name like so.

02:47.370 --> 02:52.650
And you can see a prince out attack right here and then we could easily just cancel out logger object

02:52.650 --> 02:53.390
like so.

02:53.670 --> 03:01.050
And you'll see that what javascript did was it took this variable it evaluated it found out what was

03:01.050 --> 03:05.690
inside of it and set that equal to the property name so that is now the property name.

03:05.910 --> 03:10.950
So if you ever want to do a computed value you just have to put it inside of brackets and you can even

03:10.950 --> 03:19.290
do something cooler than you could do something like For example let's string a third and then plus

03:19.350 --> 03:26.050
suffix and then all I have to do is make a variable here called suffix so go ahead and do that.

03:26.050 --> 03:36.510
Now soldiers actually make it like this suffix equals name like so and then after that Zack attack Shak

03:37.320 --> 03:39.550
I'm just making words at this point.

03:39.740 --> 03:46.860
And after that if I print out this object once again you'll see that it has a third name this time including

03:46.860 --> 03:53.190
shag so you can put variables in here that evaluates the strings just like you would when you're accessing

03:53.190 --> 03:59.700
your object with brackets notation and you can also put calculations in here or short little expressions.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.850
So long as they evaluates the strings.

04:01.860 --> 04:07.980
So in this case I add third with a variable and that is considered to be my property name whatever This

04:07.980 --> 04:08.610
evaluates.
