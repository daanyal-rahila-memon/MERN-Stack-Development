00:00.390 --> 00:08.150
Something that used to happen inside of E.S. 5 in strict mode particularly if I had an object right

00:08.250 --> 00:16.470
here like we'll do car and I had two different properties make and that would be Ford and then make

00:16.890 --> 00:19.320
a Chevy.

00:19.320 --> 00:25.320
This would throw in air so it would check in see that there are two duplicate property names right here.

00:25.410 --> 00:32.480
And so it would throw an air inside of a six B use strict mode or not using strict mode.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.840
This doesn't throw an error.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.080
They got rid of this duplicate property check right here.

00:37.290 --> 00:44.550
And instead what happens is the last property name that is listed is what is applied to the object as

00:44.550 --> 00:45.880
its actual property.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.180
So just a quick side note to keep in mind.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.600
Another small little change but definitely worth noting.
