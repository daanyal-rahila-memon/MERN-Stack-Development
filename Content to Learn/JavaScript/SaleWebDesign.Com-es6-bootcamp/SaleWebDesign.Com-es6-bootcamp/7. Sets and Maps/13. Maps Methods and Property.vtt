00:00.810 --> 00:05.880
Now as was said when we use maps there are a number of different methods and properties that we have

00:05.880 --> 00:06.690
access to.

00:06.690 --> 00:13.470
So go ahead and comment out your previous map and we'll make a brand new one so we'll do a let map equals

00:13.470 --> 00:14.630
a new map.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.220
So create a new instance of map like so and then after that we're just going to set a couple of things

00:20.220 --> 00:22.810
so we'll do mapped set.

00:23.070 --> 00:30.650
Do name because Andrew will do capital Andrew and then we'll do mapped out.

00:31.270 --> 00:37.650
And we'll do a string of age equals and then we'll do something like 74 Saldate right there.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.160
So now that we have that the next thing we can do is check to see if we have these so you cancel the

00:42.170 --> 00:50.740
log and then we'll do map has and then we just specify whatever key we want to see is available so in

00:50.740 --> 00:55.330
this case we'll see if it has a name and you can see that's true.

00:55.330 --> 01:02.860
And then we can also do our get sorted canceled out log mapped Dogget name and it'll actually return

01:02.860 --> 01:03.280
it.

01:04.210 --> 01:10.420
Then if we delete it or actually we'll go and print the size real quick so to cancel that log mapped

01:10.420 --> 01:14.470
does size and it should have a size of two as of right now.

01:14.660 --> 01:21.080
But then if we go ahead and delete it we'll do map dot delete and then we specify whatever we'd like

01:21.080 --> 01:21.740
to delete.

01:21.740 --> 01:28.340
In this case name and then we copy the council Dalt log map size bring it down you'll see that the size

01:28.340 --> 01:31.080
now shrunk to has now shrunk to 1.

01:31.190 --> 01:37.360
DO THE SAME EXACT THING WITH THE AGE saw you cancelled out log mapped.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.750
Has And then check for the age right there.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.330
And it's true.

01:43.410 --> 01:46.460
Now we can just cancel the log.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.610
Or excuse me if we can delete it or we can clear it out and this will clear out everything we'll do

01:50.610 --> 01:54.370
mapped clear and this will just clear out everything.

01:54.600 --> 02:00.430
So now if I cancel the log the map size you'll see that I get nothing.

02:00.600 --> 02:06.540
And also as a quick side note if you try to get something that isn't available on your map for example

02:06.540 --> 02:10.880
if I try to get the age right now it's going to return undefined.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.240
Just something else to keep in mind.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.400
But as you can see it's pretty familiar.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.040
Pretty much the same exact methods that we have available on our sets.
