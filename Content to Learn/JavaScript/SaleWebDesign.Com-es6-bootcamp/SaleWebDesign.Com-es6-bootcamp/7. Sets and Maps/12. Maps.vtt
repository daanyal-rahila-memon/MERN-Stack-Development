00:00.510 --> 00:06.630
Since we went into such detail about sex maps are going to look pretty familiar to you because a lot

00:06.630 --> 00:08.650
of the syntax is very similar.

00:08.700 --> 00:14.310
Now a key difference between maps and objects because I know they seem similar is with maps you're using

00:14.310 --> 00:17.710
key value pairs and with objects you're using essentially.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.640
Some would argue key value pairs particularly it's a property and a value.

00:21.630 --> 00:28.230
But either way the key difference for now is that when you use a map the key can be of any type just

00:28.230 --> 00:30.520
like the value with objects.

00:30.720 --> 00:36.960
The property name has to be a string or it has to evaluate to a string and so that severely limits what

00:36.960 --> 00:41.630
we can do whenever we want to store values and keep track of them and access them.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.240
So for example let's go ahead and make a new map.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.730
It will be pretty familiar.

00:45.750 --> 00:46.150
Will do.

00:46.160 --> 00:55.110
Let mapping equals new and then map like so now that we have that if we ever want to set or add an item

00:55.110 --> 01:00.100
to our map the way we do it is with a map set method right here.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.530
And the first argument that we pass in is going to be the key.

01:03.570 --> 01:08.730
So in this case we'll do something like a string name and will associate that with the value which is

01:08.730 --> 01:13.890
the second argument which can be Andrew and we'll do one more just for good luck and we'll do something

01:13.890 --> 01:15.300
like drink.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.660
And then that can be like water for example.

01:18.660 --> 01:23.780
Now if we want to retrieve these values the way that we do it is with another method called get.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.800
So we'll do console log map dot get.

01:27.990 --> 01:34.470
And then we specify whatever key we would like to use to get the value in this case or do name like

01:34.470 --> 01:35.010
so.

01:35.110 --> 01:38.090
And then if I save this you can see that it prints out Andrew.

01:38.250 --> 01:44.520
Now we can do that also the same thing with objects so we'll make some objects will you Konst and key

01:44.520 --> 01:52.260
one equals an objects and then we'll do Keets you also equals an object like so.

01:52.290 --> 02:01.460
Now whenever I set these all do mapped us now with do key one equals five like so and then mapped US

02:02.670 --> 02:08.850
key to equals or is associated with Hello.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.150
Now I'm going to copy this cancelled out log.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.940
That way we don't have to spend too much time typing.

02:13.970 --> 02:19.910
So I'll just copy this twice down here and down here and I'll just trade out getting the name for getting

02:20.300 --> 02:23.460
Q1 and Q2.

02:23.540 --> 02:27.620
And now if I can log these you can see it prints out 5 and then hello.

02:27.760 --> 02:36.710
So once again like objects with these maps right here we can use these objects as is a central key and

02:36.710 --> 02:39.510
then associate them with whatever value that we'd like.

02:39.620 --> 02:43.540
And I could also illustrate this to you with something like for example map dots.

02:44.050 --> 02:56.950
And then we can do like lets say five and then we'll do as TR or regular gnome like so.

02:57.170 --> 03:02.480
And then after that map does it and we can do a string five as well.

03:02.560 --> 03:09.390
You know we'll call this next to your number and these will be considered two different keys in the

03:09.390 --> 03:11.240
eyes of a javascript map.
