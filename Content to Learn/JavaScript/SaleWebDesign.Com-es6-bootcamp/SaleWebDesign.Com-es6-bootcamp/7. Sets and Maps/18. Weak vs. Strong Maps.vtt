Lastly I'll answer the question that I'm sure a lot of you probably have which is whether or not to

00:05.370 --> 00:09.420
use a week map or a strong map whenever you're working with maps.

00:09.540 --> 00:14.370
Now if you only essentially want to answer this one question right here.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.800
All you need to ask yourself is if you only want to work with object keys or not.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.800
If the answer is yes then by all means use a week map.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.260
That's a great way to go.

00:24.270 --> 00:29.550
It'll allow you to optimize your memory get the most out of it and avoid things like memory leaks.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.730
The downside though is you're not going to have a lot of visibility.

00:32.730 --> 00:37.440
So you're not going to be able to use things like size or for each to loop through things if you need

00:37.440 --> 00:42.260
this kind of visibility and you need to be able to look through your maps then probably a strong map

00:42.270 --> 00:43.550
is a way to go.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.590
Now most people as of right now know that you can use weak maps for things like objects associated with

00:49.590 --> 00:55.350
the Dom but I'm sure there's a lot of different use cases that are yet to be discovered and some that

00:55.350 --> 00:58.650
are popping up now like making data private with an object.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.840
But with that being said that's pretty much it.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.100
For maps insets.
