00:01.000 --> 00:06.250
Also very similar to the sets whenever you initialize your maps you can actually start them off with

00:06.250 --> 00:07.660
some seed data.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.970
But the way we do it is a little different.

00:09.970 --> 00:13.540
Whenever we pass in the array so make a new map right here will do.

00:13.540 --> 00:19.150
Let me make sure to comment out your old map and inside of here like before with sets we're going to

00:19.150 --> 00:20.750
pass in an array.

00:20.770 --> 00:25.750
The difference is that every item in the array must itself be an array.

00:26.110 --> 00:33.400
And inside of that array item right there the first item in this array is going to be the key and the

00:33.400 --> 00:36.220
second item is going to be the value.

00:36.460 --> 00:42.580
So you can see right here we pass in an array and then every item inside of the array must itself be

00:42.580 --> 00:47.280
an array where this item this first into see right here is the key.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.390
And the second into C is the value.

00:49.390 --> 00:51.550
So after that I'll add another one.

00:51.580 --> 00:57.940
We'll do something like age set that equal to what's a good age 39 and then if we go ahead and try and

00:57.940 --> 01:06.640
get these you'll see counselled or log map doget and we'll just get the name and then we'll copy this

01:06.880 --> 01:13.780
and go down and then we'll get the age and then if we go ahead and print this out and just see what

01:13.780 --> 01:17.230
the size is you'll see it works just as you would expect it to.
