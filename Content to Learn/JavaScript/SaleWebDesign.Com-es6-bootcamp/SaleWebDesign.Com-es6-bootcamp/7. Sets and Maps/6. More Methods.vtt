So many go in common tell these canceled logs right here.

00:04.330 --> 00:09.040
Just so everything is really clear when we start to cancel that log a few other things so I'll comment

00:09.040 --> 00:12.200
out and I'll comment out this now.

00:12.220 --> 00:12.760
That's great.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.310
We learn how we can add things to our set and also how we might take things away from our insert.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.830
But how do we delete things.

00:19.870 --> 00:20.980
Well pretty simple.

00:20.980 --> 00:27.120
What I can do is just our set dot delete and then specify whatever value I want to delete.

00:27.200 --> 00:33.600
Let's say I want to delete five and then I'm going to comment this back in and then get a copy and then

00:33.730 --> 00:40.810
load it back in like so save it you're going to see first my size for my set is 5 and then after I delete

00:41.170 --> 00:44.070
one of the members of the set then it's going to be a 4.

00:44.170 --> 00:48.290
Last thing that you can do is if you want to you can check to see if it has.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.530
So comment this back in and check to see if 5 is even there now.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.040
And you're going to see it says false.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.320
No it's not there.

00:55.330 --> 01:00.260
Aside from that you can also just completely clear out your set where you do that.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.750
Just take your access.

01:02.790 --> 01:06.310
The clear method just invoke it like so.

01:06.310 --> 01:12.460
And now if I counsel that log my size after I completely clear it out you'll see it's zero.

01:12.460 --> 01:18.100
So I've completely cleared out the it's completely empty and I'd have to start over adding new values

01:18.100 --> 01:18.670
to it again.
