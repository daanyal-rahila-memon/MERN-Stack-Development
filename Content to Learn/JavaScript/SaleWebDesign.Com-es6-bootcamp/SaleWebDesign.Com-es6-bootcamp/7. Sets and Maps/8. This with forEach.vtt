00:00.390 --> 00:05.930
As with when you work with a raise whenever you work with sets and use for each You can also pass in

00:05.940 --> 00:11.190
the key word this as a second argument to that method so go and show you that right now we'll do a new

00:11.190 --> 00:20.050
set we'll do let's set new set and we'll go ahead and pass this or rates to the constructor like so.

00:20.050 --> 00:25.710
And then after that I'm gonna go ahead and define an object called processor and it's going to have

00:25.710 --> 00:36.150
an output and it's going to take value as an argument like so if I can just type it correctly and then

00:36.150 --> 00:39.350
I'm just going to cancel it out log the value really simple.

00:39.360 --> 00:45.290
And then after this method I'm going to add another method called process and it's going to take a data

00:45.290 --> 00:50.760
set and inside of here I'm going to take that data set and I'm just going to loop through it with a

00:50.760 --> 00:59.330
For Each loop and inside of here when I pass a function and it's going to be like so.

00:59.720 --> 01:11.540
And inside of here I'm just going to invoke this output I can get this output is Vau like so and then

01:12.230 --> 01:17.630
right now the way that the word this is it's not going to work it's not going to invoke the correct

01:17.630 --> 01:18.070
method.

01:18.080 --> 01:24.620
So what we need to do is set the key word correctly by passing in this as the second argument to this

01:24.620 --> 01:25.720
method right here.

01:25.910 --> 01:35.760
So now whenever I call process on processor like so impasse in my set it should work as expected and

01:35.760 --> 01:37.940
it does it brings out one in two.

01:37.980 --> 01:44.220
Now another way to do this is just use an arrow function because as we remember an arrow function inherits

01:44.220 --> 01:47.640
the keyword this from its closest inclosing parent.

01:47.640 --> 01:54.430
So in this case it would be equal to processor is what this would be equal to inside of an arrow function.

01:54.540 --> 02:03.420
So I could just get rid of this right here and make an arrow function and then I could just return if

02:03.420 --> 02:04.710
I wanted to I could just return.

02:04.710 --> 02:06.990
But in this case will add curly braces.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.600
Cancel the log or not cancel dot log.

02:10.620 --> 02:15.610
You can just do this dot output and then Vau like so.

02:15.780 --> 02:20.070
And that will work just as well and we don't even have to specify the key word this because of how the

02:20.070 --> 02:21.210
arrow function works.
