Now of course if I wanted to take this a step further I absolutely could and could give this destructuring

00:07.080 --> 00:09.030
right here its own name.

00:09.060 --> 00:15.570
So now temperament will not be a variable locally defined but local temperament will be a variable.

00:15.570 --> 00:18.870
So now if I switch those out it'll actually work.

00:18.870 --> 00:25.020
So once again these parentheses indicate destructuring I want to first deconstructing get to Best Friend

00:25.020 --> 00:27.440
property then on the right.

00:27.480 --> 00:33.780
I want to pull out a variable here so I wrap it inside of these curly braces and I want to find the

00:33.780 --> 00:40.550
temperament and then I want to set the local temperament variable equal temperament like so.
