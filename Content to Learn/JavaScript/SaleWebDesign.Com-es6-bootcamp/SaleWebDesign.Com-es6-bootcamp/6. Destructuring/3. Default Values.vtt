00:00.990 --> 00:06.690
So we're going to go ahead and comment all of this out and then afterwards we're going to set something

00:06.690 --> 00:08.470
called default values.

00:08.730 --> 00:16.710
Now what happens whenever we use destructuring with an object literal like so we do contest RBJ and

00:16.710 --> 00:26.200
then we'll do like name is Fuyu identifier is the best care.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.590
So nothing too crazy right here.

00:28.610 --> 00:36.410
Then inside we make that object literal object literal just curly braces as they're called here for

00:36.410 --> 00:38.780
destructuring identifier.

00:38.780 --> 00:42.650
Now we specify the object we want to pull all this data out of.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.490
And then we can just cancel it out.

00:46.530 --> 00:52.860
Name and identified identifier when we write the identifier.

00:52.980 --> 01:01.910
We go and if I don't if you're having trouble spell on here Scuse me so you can see it in self who the

01:01.910 --> 01:02.330
best.

01:02.330 --> 01:09.350
Now what happens if I specify something else like let's say another variable here and we'll just call

01:09.350 --> 01:12.570
this cup we can call it whatever.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.470
Well what's going to happen is the engine is going to look to see if there's any property in here by

01:18.470 --> 01:19.450
the name of cup.

01:19.460 --> 01:26.270
And if it doesn't find anything it's going to set this particular variable to undefined though it will

01:26.270 --> 01:27.800
still technically exist.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.290
It has been declared.

01:29.300 --> 01:32.440
It just hasn't been initialized or set to a value.

01:32.450 --> 01:38.600
So what you can do to handle this is you can set a default value of your own instead of it being a default

01:38.600 --> 01:41.660
value of undefined you can set a default value of whatever you'd like.

01:41.660 --> 01:49.960
True or you know coffee cup for example and now it says who the best coffee cup or any other variable

01:49.980 --> 01:52.630
or any other default value that you might think of.
