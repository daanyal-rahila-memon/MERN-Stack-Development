You know a couple of things I want you to know or at least be aware of as far as destructuring are deconstructing

00:06.900 --> 00:13.860
excuse me these parameters right here is that they are required so you write in this syntax right here

00:14.260 --> 00:18.480
then this particular perimeter will be required by Javascript.

00:18.630 --> 00:24.870
So if I omit this options object that I pass in right here and reload it you're going to see it throws

00:24.870 --> 00:29.390
me an error cannot deconstruct property secure of undefined or NULL.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.400
So in other words these are going to all default.

00:32.580 --> 00:36.960
All of these values inside of you are all going to default to no or undefined.

00:36.990 --> 00:40.880
Similar to what we did with object literal deconstructing.

00:40.910 --> 00:44.300
So in other words going to throw us an error which is not OK.

00:44.490 --> 00:50.140
So since that's going to happen the way we could get around this is to set a default value.

00:50.220 --> 00:54.790
So what we could do is set this equal to an empty object as default.

00:54.960 --> 01:01.740
And the way we give a default parameter value right here is the same as what we did before with object

01:01.740 --> 01:02.320
literals.

01:02.340 --> 01:07.530
And also with our array syntax so now you can see it actually doesn't throw an error.

01:07.710 --> 01:13.890
And on top of that you can actually assign default values to particular things like your properties

01:14.160 --> 01:14.970
inside of here.

01:14.970 --> 01:19.900
So well technically these would be made into variables but they look like properties so we're going

01:19.950 --> 01:26.670
bring this down to the next line like so and then I'm just going to pop them down to show you that not

01:26.670 --> 01:33.210
only can we give a default value for this entire object that is to be passed in but we can also give

01:33.210 --> 01:39.510
a default value for individual properties if whenever we pass in an object those properties are not

01:39.510 --> 01:40.520
specified.

01:40.530 --> 01:47.710
So in this case I'll give it a default value of true and I'll give this one a default value of foo.

01:48.870 --> 01:52.920
And then I'll give it a default of 2000 for expires.

01:52.950 --> 01:59.970
So now if I go ahead and I pass it in let's say I pass this object and I'll bring this up so you can

01:59.970 --> 02:02.430
see it very close to each other.

02:02.820 --> 02:07.310
If I pass this object and all I specify is domain.

02:07.590 --> 02:15.360
So do domain do w w w like so and then we can print these out.

02:15.520 --> 02:26.980
So when I go ahead and print out this options right here so do cancel dot log secure domain path expires

02:28.570 --> 02:33.380
like so and you can see that all of our default values work.

02:33.440 --> 02:39.950
And the one value that we did pass in the one property we did pass in on our object is already set for

02:39.950 --> 02:40.850
the domain.

02:40.850 --> 02:47.090
So that is one thing to keep in mind remember if you deconstruct parameters then on that particular

02:47.090 --> 02:52.970
parameter is going to be required a way to get around it is to set a default value for that parameter.

02:52.970 --> 02:58.430
And if you happen to be passing an objects just like before with object literal syntax you can define

02:58.430 --> 03:01.220
default values for these properties right here.

03:01.340 --> 03:06.200
In the case that an object is passed in like here but certain properties aren't specified.
