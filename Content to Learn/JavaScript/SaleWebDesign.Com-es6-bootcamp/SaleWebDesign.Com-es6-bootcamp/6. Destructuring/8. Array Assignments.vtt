Just as with objects with a raise you can also do a destructuring assignment.

00:05.370 --> 00:10.300
So what we'll do is this time we'll make some colors and we'll put those in an array.

00:10.300 --> 00:15.160
Somebody like red blue and green.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.320
And then after that we'll make some variables here will do.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.150
Actually I can just do the short cut.

00:21.160 --> 00:29.900
So in this case just first color which is going to be like purple and then the second color which will

00:29.900 --> 00:32.940
be something like Gray.

00:32.960 --> 00:39.920
Now after I do that the next thing that I can do is assign things so I can do first color and then second

00:39.920 --> 00:43.590
color and instead of equal to the colors in the array.

00:44.030 --> 00:46.760
And then I'll do cancel that log.

00:47.390 --> 00:53.360
First color second color then I'll copy it if I can.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.400
There we go.

00:54.530 --> 01:00.110
Copy down below and you can see I assigned these two different variables brand new values.

01:00.250 --> 01:07.670
And unlike object destructuring with array destructuring assignments you don't have to wrap it in parentheses

01:07.670 --> 01:09.530
so you can just leave this as is.
