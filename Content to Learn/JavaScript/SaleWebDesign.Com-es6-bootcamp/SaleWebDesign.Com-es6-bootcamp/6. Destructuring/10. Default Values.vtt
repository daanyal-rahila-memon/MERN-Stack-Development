We can also use default values with the raid structuring so I'll just do let's say let color array one

00:07.830 --> 00:17.760
item read like so then if I want to I can do that in first color and then after that second color and

00:17.760 --> 00:23.430
on the off chance that there is no second item in the array I'll set it to a default of green.

00:23.430 --> 00:26.240
Very similar syntax to what we did before.

00:26.250 --> 00:31.880
Now if I canceled out log in then I copy and paste these two right here.

00:32.070 --> 00:35.820
You'll see that the default value is indeed assigned.
