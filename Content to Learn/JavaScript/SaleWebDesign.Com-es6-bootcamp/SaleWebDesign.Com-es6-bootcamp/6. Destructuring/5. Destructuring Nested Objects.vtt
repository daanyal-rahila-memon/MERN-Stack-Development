00:00.600 --> 00:07.050
So far we've worked with flat objects if you will one dimensional they're not nested or anything like

00:07.050 --> 00:07.370
that.

00:07.410 --> 00:12.400
And sometimes we do need to work with nested objects so how might we structure those.

00:12.570 --> 00:15.540
Well first let's make a new user.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.680
And inside of that user.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.890
They will have a couple of things for themselves.

00:19.890 --> 00:22.470
They'll have a name perhaps Johnny.

00:22.470 --> 00:23.310
Johnny Boy.

00:23.670 --> 00:24.530
Like so.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.210
And then after that an agent will do thirty four.

00:28.260 --> 00:34.600
And then after that we'll do like a best friend will be a good one best friend.

00:34.780 --> 00:37.330
And then after that we'll have an object inside of there.

00:37.380 --> 00:40.080
And his name will be like Malcolm.

00:40.620 --> 00:46.110
And then after that his age will be 32 and so on and so forth.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.510
So with that being said we should be good to go.

00:48.510 --> 00:53.520
I'm going to go ahead and give this another property just so I can differentiate these two properties

00:53.520 --> 00:54.460
right here.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.270
So Will do.

00:56.340 --> 01:00.250
Temperament should have picked an easier word to spell.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.240
Docile is good though.

01:02.340 --> 01:08.790
So now that we have that set the way I would access the structure I should say a nested object is to

01:08.790 --> 01:10.770
do something along these lines.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.020
So do let.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.420
And then after that curly braces I'm going to assign user right there.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.830
Now first I need a location to start at.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.300
So we're looking inside of this object.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.030
And as we know before first notify my location.

01:28.050 --> 01:31.180
So in this case I want to start at best friend.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.670
So anything inside of these curly braces is going to be the location that I want.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.080
The property is.

01:37.440 --> 01:45.900
And then after that going to do a colon do some more curly braces and then we'll do temperament difficult

01:45.900 --> 01:48.660
word to spell but we get it either way.

01:48.810 --> 01:54.270
So now that we have that going to space these out just so it's very clear to you what's happening.

01:54.480 --> 02:03.190
And then what I can do is console log temperament and it will work out just fine or at least it should.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.940
Now I save it and you can see it prints out DOS syle.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.670
So what is going on.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.410
Exactly.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.220
Know it looks a little confusing.

02:10.530 --> 02:18.180
Well if you remember from the previous video what we did was essentially we took these different different

02:18.180 --> 02:25.890
destructuring syntax right here and on the left hand side of the colon that is the property we want

02:25.890 --> 02:35.370
to start at the location that we defined on the right hand side of the colon is the actual variable

02:35.460 --> 02:37.540
that we want to define locally.

02:37.770 --> 02:42.480
Now by wrapping something in parentheses we're saying we want to structure it.

02:42.810 --> 02:49.650
So what I've done here is I wrap this in the first set of curly braces right here.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.500
And I say best friend on the left of the colon.

02:53.550 --> 03:00.540
So this means start at the best friend property inside of the user object on the right hand side.

03:00.660 --> 03:04.240
I say OK I want to make a variable here.

03:04.320 --> 03:11.610
This is the name of the variable i want to define locally but I also wrap this inside of curly braces

03:12.120 --> 03:16.650
which means that I also want to the structure here.

03:16.800 --> 03:23.030
So this is another location within this location by doing two curly braces.
