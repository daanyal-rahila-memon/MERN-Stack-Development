In most cases what I've taught you so far about array destructuring is all you're really going to need.

00:06.030 --> 00:09.560
But there's another cool thing that you can do that I want to show you.

00:09.750 --> 00:15.180
You can actually swap out values by using this destructuring syntax which is some pretty common with

00:15.180 --> 00:19.920
things like for example sorting algorithms so what do I mean by swapping values.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.350
Well let's say we have two variables we'll have a which is equal to 1 and B which is equal to 2.

00:25.350 --> 00:29.680
Now let's say I want to swap these so that way a equals two equals one.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.450
Wed typically have to do it if I was inside of E.S. 5 is that have to create a temporary variable and

00:35.460 --> 00:38.110
I'll just go ahead and Tyrel this yes.

00:38.150 --> 00:48.620
5 And then what I do is first I'd save a reference to B sides Tim equal to B then after that I could

00:48.620 --> 00:50.290
override the value.

00:50.300 --> 00:57.730
So in this case what I want to do now is since I've saved my value I can set be equal to A and then

00:57.730 --> 01:10.110
after that I can set a equal to temp then if I cancel that log and b it should be 2 and 1.

01:10.300 --> 01:16.570
And then if I canceled out log before I made the swap it'll show 1 and 2.

01:16.580 --> 01:19.080
So we swapped them out or we have to do with say B.

01:19.140 --> 01:24.300
Then we can override it and then we can set a equal to whatever we saved in the temporary variable.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.010
All of this is very unnecessary.

01:26.010 --> 01:32.700
Instead of year 6 instead well you can do is I'm going to title this ESX 6.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.450
I cannot write today.

01:34.450 --> 01:35.000
There we go.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.450
So what I can do instead is I'll do let C equals 1 and then d equals 2.

01:43.540 --> 01:46.120
No temporary variable in this case.

01:46.120 --> 01:55.120
I'm just going to do DC inside of this array literal syntax and then see the inside of the array.

01:55.120 --> 02:03.370
Now if I do a concert or log of them both before and after like so pop down you're going to see it prints

02:03.370 --> 02:06.550
out 1 2 and then 2 1 so we accomplish the exact same thing.

02:06.550 --> 02:07.450
How do we do it.

02:07.660 --> 02:16.150
Well what we did is we took these variables and created a temporary array literal then we use the array

02:16.160 --> 02:23.030
destructuring syntax to pull out these values into variables according to their position.

02:23.050 --> 02:28.890
So we're pulling out the value of c and assigning it to the value to the variable d..

02:28.900 --> 02:30.640
Same thing with C and D here.

02:30.730 --> 02:36.580
We're pulling out the value of D and assigning it to the variable c and the destructuring is happening

02:36.610 --> 02:38.950
on this temporary array that we created.
