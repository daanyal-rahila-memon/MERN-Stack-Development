We can also do destructuring of nested arrays so in other words is going to be really similar.

00:07.680 --> 00:13.190
But at the same time simpler than what we did with object literals and object the structuring.

00:13.260 --> 00:23.530
So let's say I have some colors here will do colors and we'll do like red and we'll do an array of balloons

00:23.850 --> 00:34.710
blue or let's do sky blue and then Dodger blue and then Navy and after that we'll throw it outside of

00:34.710 --> 00:40.550
we'll do green like so in order to structure this it'll be pretty simple.

00:40.590 --> 00:45.450
We'll just do it let destructuring what do first color.

00:45.450 --> 00:51.930
And then I'm going to assign it to colors like so and then in order to get to the nested part what I'll

00:51.930 --> 00:53.430
do is a comma.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.100
It's the second item in the array.

00:55.110 --> 00:57.020
But now I want to nest into that.

00:57.300 --> 01:06.300
So I'll do let's say second color here color and then maybe I want to skip this one so I'll skip out

01:06.300 --> 01:11.600
of that and then I'll do third color like so third color.

01:11.850 --> 01:19.440
And then outside of this nest right here I'll hop over and I'll do fourth color like so and then obviously

01:19.440 --> 01:20.690
I can print these out.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.410
I want to.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.820
But you'll see that result regardless.

01:23.820 --> 01:28.520
So in this case I'll just copy this and then delete a couple of things.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.650
So just copy this into your consulate log.

01:31.800 --> 01:41.100
And then after that I can just delete delete and then delete like so and you can see it does a great

01:41.130 --> 01:43.410
job of skipping over Dodger blue.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.080
So pretty much the same syntax.

01:45.090 --> 01:48.600
Just to mess down into another array specify another bracket.
