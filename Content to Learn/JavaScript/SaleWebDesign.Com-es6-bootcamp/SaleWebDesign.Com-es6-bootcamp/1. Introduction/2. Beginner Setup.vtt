All right now we're going to go ahead and get set up.

00:03.090 --> 00:07.900
If you already have a preferred set up on your machine for development day by all means use that set

00:07.900 --> 00:08.450
up.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.050
I'm going to give two different options.

00:10.050 --> 00:14.640
First one is more for beginners and the second one is more for people who are a little more familiar

00:14.640 --> 00:15.810
with the back end.

00:15.840 --> 00:20.850
So if you go to bracket start I know this is going to be the option for beginners and all you have to

00:20.850 --> 00:26.400
do is download brackets and then follow the set up steps and after you're done you should be able to

00:26.400 --> 00:29.610
pin it to your task bar and have that available to you.

00:29.610 --> 00:34.950
Bracket's is a great text editor for beginners in the main reason that I would be using it as a beginner

00:35.320 --> 00:37.680
is because of this little lightning bolt right here.

00:37.690 --> 00:43.000
What it's going to do is give you a live preview of your web page so it'll automatically sync it with

00:43.000 --> 00:43.950
your browser.

00:43.950 --> 00:49.260
And any time you save something it will automatically reload the web page with the changes that you've

00:49.260 --> 00:55.350
made so it will be a lot easier to follow along and actually do what I'm doing in the future videos.
