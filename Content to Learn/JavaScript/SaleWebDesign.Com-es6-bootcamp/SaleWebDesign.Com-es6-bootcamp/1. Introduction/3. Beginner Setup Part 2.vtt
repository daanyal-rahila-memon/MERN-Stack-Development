00:00.600 --> 00:05.810
So for this next module we're going to talk about 6 which is a pretty interesting topic.

00:05.820 --> 00:10.560
I'm going to have a whole separate video explaining it but what you'll need to do is go ahead and go

00:10.560 --> 00:11.660
to your course folder.

00:11.670 --> 00:16.210
Open up javascript and then make a new folder inside they're called iOS 6.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.040
Do a right hand click and open it as a bracket's project.

00:20.040 --> 00:24.540
Once you have that set up we'll get our basic skeleton so we can kind of test drive a couple of these

00:24.540 --> 00:32.280
features or do index each TMLC Once you have the folder open up get my skeleton going like so Year 6

00:32.370 --> 00:37.950
and then after that all we get to do is create our first javascript file.

00:38.070 --> 00:44.120
So what we'll do is hit new file and then we'll call it block underscore scope.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.970
Dodgiest like so.

00:46.170 --> 00:53.760
And after that we can hop back over to our HMO login script tag throw on a source attribute with the

00:53.760 --> 00:55.930
block scope on it and we're good to go.
