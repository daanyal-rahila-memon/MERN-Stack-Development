If you don't want to use brackets there is a more advanced option what you can do is go to code Visual

00:06.780 --> 00:13.080
Studio dot com and this is the name of the text editor or slash I-T Visual Studio code.

00:13.140 --> 00:19.070
It is my preferred text editor slash IEEE it's really really cool fast loading.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.880
It's got a lot of great things you can add on to it but with all that being said if you want to use

00:23.880 --> 00:26.610
this text editor all you have to do is hit download.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.690
It should pick up what machine you're using.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.010
But they have different builds for all of the different doses.

00:32.100 --> 00:38.040
And you'll notice to the right it says stable and insiders stable is going to be just their official

00:38.040 --> 00:43.980
releases and insiders is going to be the latest latest version of the code that they roll out every

00:43.980 --> 00:45.720
night or at least every week.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.820
So you'll have access to the latest features that the people at Microsoft have access to.

00:50.820 --> 00:54.660
So whichever one you decide to use they both should work perfectly fine.

00:54.660 --> 00:59.090
But after you have that downloaded the next step is going to be to go to No.

00:59.110 --> 01:00.390
J.S. dot org.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.820
And then scroll down here where it says download and it'll pick up what machine you're using but just

01:05.820 --> 01:09.420
hit the current version or you can use this version.

01:09.450 --> 01:14.830
Eight point eleven point four at the time you see this video the numbers could be different.

01:14.880 --> 01:19.340
It's not really going to do anything detrimental if you download a later version.

01:19.340 --> 01:25.080
It should be fine but once you have that downloaded you can go ahead and make a folder.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.630
And so what I would do is personally make a folder to organize everything.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.930
So I've already done that.

01:29.970 --> 01:35.580
But then you can just right click on the folder that you create and it'll say open with code and so

01:35.580 --> 01:39.720
that will allow you to basically open this as a VS code project.

01:39.720 --> 01:44.970
So once you do that it should open up something that looks similar to this without all of the files

01:44.970 --> 01:45.990
that I have.

01:45.990 --> 01:49.340
Now the next thing that we're going to do is use our command line.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.170
So I'm going to hit Control J.

01:51.420 --> 01:56.550
And that would be Command G on the Mac and go to where it says terminal right here.

01:56.940 --> 02:02.240
And this is actually why we downloaded no just so we can use NPM package.

02:02.310 --> 02:06.720
And so as soon as this switches over all you have to do is hit him.

02:06.820 --> 02:12.130
PM in it and we'll be able to start installing packages inside of our project.
