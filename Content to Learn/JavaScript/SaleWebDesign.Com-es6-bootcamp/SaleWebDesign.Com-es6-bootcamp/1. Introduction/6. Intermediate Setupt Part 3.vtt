00:00.660 --> 00:03.750
Once everything is finished downloading we should be good to go.

00:03.750 --> 00:08.030
The last thing for us to do is just to make HCM l file to serve.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.530
So we'll do index da h Tummo.

00:10.710 --> 00:16.530
You make new files inside of us code by hitting this kind of hollow document icon right here.

00:16.740 --> 00:22.290
And then after that we just need to do our set up so as code comes with Amut by default so I have to

00:22.290 --> 00:25.170
do is hit exclamation point and then enter.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.180
And that will give me everything that I need.

00:27.210 --> 00:34.980
I'll maybe change the title to iOS 6 and then after that I'll just display some dummy text Lauren like

00:34.980 --> 00:36.660
so perfect.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.600
Like I said it comes of Emett by default.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.700
And if you don't know about it it's definitely worth checking out.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.350
It'll save you a lot of time.

00:43.350 --> 00:48.630
All you have to do is hit the name of a particular tag that you want to use like for example age 1 and

00:48.630 --> 00:52.350
then you can hit tab or enter and it loads in that tag just like that.

00:52.350 --> 00:56.670
So we're not going be working with HMO too much so we don't have to worry about that.

00:56.910 --> 01:02.670
But either way now that we have all of our HMO written now the next thing for us to do is just run NPM

01:02.970 --> 01:03.810
start.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.540
And it may take a second.

01:05.550 --> 01:11.010
But as soon as it finishes up it's going to spin up our server and automatically load it into whatever

01:11.010 --> 01:13.400
our default browser happens to be.
