Hello and welcome to the course.

00:02.070 --> 00:03.620
So for those of you who are new here.

00:03.630 --> 00:05.480
My name is Andrew and welcome.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.810
In this course we're going to be talking about javascript specifically.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.770
We're going to be talking about E6.

00:10.770 --> 00:15.270
And for those of you who are completely new to programming I really don't recommend this course but

00:15.330 --> 00:20.880
javascript is the programming language of the web as of the time of this recording it's the only language

00:20.880 --> 00:22.220
that can be used on the front end.

00:22.260 --> 00:29.250
As a programming language and it is perhaps one of the most popular ones in existence iOS 6 was essentially

00:29.280 --> 00:34.110
an update and it was perhaps one of the biggest updates in the history of the language.

00:34.110 --> 00:39.090
So my goal in this course is to teach you everything that you need to know about this update from front

00:39.090 --> 00:39.730
to back.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.610
And I only teach you the syntax for the new features that are available to you but also kind of explain

00:44.610 --> 00:49.310
different use cases and how you might implement these features in your code today.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.260
Now there is a lot of new features in this course and some of them are still being figured out as far

00:55.260 --> 00:58.290
as how they can be applied to real life code in the wild.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.090
But at the end of the day I'm going to teach you from front to back.

01:01.110 --> 01:06.810
And the use cases that have arisen for a lot of these new features so with all of that being said let's

01:06.810 --> 01:07.930
go ahead and get star.
