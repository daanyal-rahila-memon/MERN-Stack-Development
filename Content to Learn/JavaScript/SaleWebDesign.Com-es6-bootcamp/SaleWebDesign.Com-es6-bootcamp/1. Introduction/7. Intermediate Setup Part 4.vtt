00:00.420 --> 00:06.440
Now what should have happened is a new browser tab should have opened up with your default browser and

00:06.440 --> 00:09.440
load it in the HCM file that we just created.

00:09.480 --> 00:14.610
Now that we have that set up the next thing for us to do is going to be to create a new file called

00:14.910 --> 00:17.330
block underscore scope.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.180
So go ahead and pause it if you need to and create that file.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.060
Now mission control and control be to just kind of give me a more full screen view.

00:26.060 --> 00:31.590
And then after that I'll go to index dot h T.M. and right under or right above the body tag I should

00:31.590 --> 00:34.660
say I'm going to add a script tag so I'm going to write scripts.

00:34.740 --> 00:41.300
And then after that SIRC and I'll set that equal to block underscore scope.

00:41.560 --> 00:42.430
Yes.

00:42.660 --> 00:48.250
And then after that I'm going to go ahead and open up my console so I do control shift.

00:48.300 --> 00:55.200
That's command shift on the Mac and it should open up the actual console for me to see and make sure

00:55.200 --> 00:57.950
that everything's working the way that it's supposed to.

00:57.990 --> 01:02.100
Now this would work the same on Chrome or Firefox.

01:02.100 --> 01:07.480
I don't really mess with Internet Explore or edge but I'm assuming it would work the same way.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.730
I'm not really familiar with their debug but either way.

01:10.770 --> 01:14.580
Now just to make sure this works we're going to go ahead and cancel that log.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.890
I'm working like so save that.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.000
See what happens.

01:22.050 --> 01:23.410
And let's see.

01:23.620 --> 01:24.110
Logs.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.040
I'm working so it seems like everything is working the way that it's supposed to.

01:28.080 --> 01:34.140
Now the first thing for us to do is going to be talking about a new type of scope available to us inside

01:34.170 --> 01:35.010
of javascript.
