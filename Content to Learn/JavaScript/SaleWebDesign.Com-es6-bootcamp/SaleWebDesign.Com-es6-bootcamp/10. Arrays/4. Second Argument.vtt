You could actually even go a step further with the array from syntax right here and show you that what

00:07.680 --> 00:11.490
I mean is you can add a second argument and this will be like a mapping function.

00:11.490 --> 00:18.480
So essentially what it'll do is what an arrow function and we'll take a value and this value is going

00:18.480 --> 00:24.720
to be represented as whatever the particular indices of this array like object is whatever their particular

00:24.720 --> 00:25.720
property is.

00:25.910 --> 00:32.490
And inside of here I'm going to perform an operation on it and return someone to do value and then plus

00:32.490 --> 00:33.330
two.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.360
And in this case I'll make sure that these are numbers.

00:36.540 --> 00:44.250
That way you don't have to risk is one to like so then I'm going to save this and you can see that whenever

00:44.250 --> 00:46.700
it was an argument's object it was 1 2.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.140
But now that it's an array it is 3 4.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.790
So we add this basic math thing.

00:51.810 --> 00:58.230
Our mapping function right here and it allows us to do some calculations on it or perform some operations

00:58.230 --> 01:04.340
on it before storing it as its final value in the corresponding index in the array.

01:04.440 --> 01:10.570
So it's a great way to do some extra work to your array like object before you convert into an array.

01:10.770 --> 01:16.590
And then all you have to do is return whatever you would like to be stored as an item in that array.
