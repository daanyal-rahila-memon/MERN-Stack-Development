00:00.420 --> 00:03.390
Another method that was added is called fill.

00:03.390 --> 00:08.850
And essentially what it's going to do is fill up the items in the array with a certain value that we

00:08.850 --> 00:09.780
specify.

00:09.960 --> 00:20.430
So to show this to you I'm going to basically go and just do numbers fill and then one then counseled.

00:21.030 --> 00:26.870
Numbers like so and you can see it now it's still the same array.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.600
It's got four items in it.

00:28.770 --> 00:32.590
But in this case we've filled it all up with a value of 1.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.720
So it's a great way to replace certain items in your array.

00:36.720 --> 00:43.230
Now this is only the first argument that we pass in the first argument is what we want to fill with.

00:43.950 --> 00:49.970
And then we can specify a second argument which is essentially what we want to start.

00:50.010 --> 00:56.430
So the starting index so if I specify one that means it's going to start filling this array with the

00:56.430 --> 00:59.060
number 1 and it's going to start right here.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.570
Forty five because that's the number one index.

01:01.650 --> 01:04.970
And I started off at two because I noticed some saying the word one a lot.

01:05.310 --> 01:11.520
So by specifying a star index of two which is inclusive it means it's going to start at 67 and just

01:11.520 --> 01:13.710
fill it up with ones right here.

01:13.710 --> 01:19.680
So we do that and you can see it starts at 67 and fills it up with the value of one and you can also

01:19.740 --> 01:21.480
do a ending index.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.390
So in other words where you want it to stop ending if you do not include your end index right here where

01:27.390 --> 01:32.340
you want it to start filling up then it will just go all the way to the end of the array and use the

01:32.340 --> 01:35.250
length of the array automatically as an index.

01:35.250 --> 01:40.190
So what I'll do here is I'll start at 1 and then I'll end it too.

01:40.380 --> 01:44.410
So we'll start at 45 and we will end 67.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.230
And so you'll see that it only replaces one value right here.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.870
The reason for that is because the star index is inclusive and the end index is non-inclusive which

01:54.870 --> 01:59.160
means it will not include this index right here in the filling.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.730
So in order to actually fill 67 with one I would have to change this to three like so.
