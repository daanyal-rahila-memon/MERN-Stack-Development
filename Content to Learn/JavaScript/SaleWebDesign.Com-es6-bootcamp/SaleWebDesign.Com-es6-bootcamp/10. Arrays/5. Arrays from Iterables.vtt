You can also use the array from method with iterable.

00:04.050 --> 00:11.310
So to illustrate that we'll make a new set and we'll just pass in an array to initialize some values

00:11.310 --> 00:16.620
like so and then after that all we have to do is consulate or log this.

00:16.950 --> 00:25.290
And then we're going to take this and use it to make an array so do Konst array equals array from parentheses

00:25.290 --> 00:33.690
pass in the set and then counsel dot log array like so as you can see it was originally s.a I used it

00:33.690 --> 00:40.100
to make an array so we can not only work with array like objects but we can also use this with iterable.

00:40.350 --> 00:46.050
And by that logic it means we can also work on any kind of object with a symbol da iterator.

00:46.050 --> 00:53.430
So for example we'll do a concert RBJ equals an object right here and inside of here we're just going

00:53.430 --> 01:03.640
to do a generator function this symbol if I can't spell correctly this will work to iterator like so.

01:03.640 --> 01:12.090
Iterator then inside of here we're going to do is just yield one and then yield to then yield three

01:13.320 --> 01:14.610
like so.

01:14.610 --> 01:23.340
Then after that I can do Konst array two equals a radar from and I'll just pass this object directly

01:23.340 --> 01:25.230
since it has an iterator on it.

01:25.230 --> 01:29.790
And I might even pass in a mapping function so I'll do value plus one.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.220
And then I don't need parentheses because if it's just a one line return statement there's no need for

01:35.220 --> 01:36.560
parentheses.

01:36.620 --> 01:49.080
And then after that I'll just cancel dot log array to like so an unexpected token on line 60 right here

01:49.120 --> 01:51.600
I use parentheses as always.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.280
There we go.

01:52.290 --> 01:58.910
Now you can see it turn this object right here with a symbol iterator on it into an array as well.
