00:00.450 --> 00:04.450
You can also create access or properties to illustrate that to you.

00:04.450 --> 00:06.640
We're going to do something a little different.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.440
We'll add some content to our element of right here and then we'll go back and we'll do something.

00:12.540 --> 00:18.300
Now you can see we have some text on the screen what we might do is create a class that's meant to wrap

00:18.300 --> 00:26.410
a custom element so the way we do this is class custom HMO elements like so.

00:26.640 --> 00:33.150
And then inside of here we can do our constructor constructor tour and we'll define our own properties

00:33.150 --> 00:35.560
for the instance of this class right here.

00:35.910 --> 00:41.170
And it's just going to be this element equals element like so.

00:41.220 --> 00:47.820
Now originally the way that we define getters and setters is we would do like objects and then define

00:47.820 --> 00:49.100
property.

00:49.390 --> 00:55.180
And we pass in the prototype chain like so and then we pass in the name that we want to give it.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.850
And then we give our configurable object or object configuration.

00:59.850 --> 01:02.820
Here we have this nice syntactic sugar on top.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.330
So instead all we have to do is write.

01:04.410 --> 01:08.210
Get it right there and I'll call this h m l.

01:08.730 --> 01:11.700
And the goal of this is just to return the inner AGM.

01:11.700 --> 01:22.020
So I'm just going to return this dot element dot inner h t m l like so and for the center it's going

01:22.020 --> 01:25.800
to be the same name and it's going to get a value passed in.

01:26.070 --> 01:35.300
And in this case we're going to see the inner edge symbol of the elements equal to whatever gets passed

01:35.300 --> 01:35.970
in.

01:35.970 --> 01:41.010
Now obviously there's trust issues that are to be associated with this especially if this is data that

01:41.010 --> 01:42.420
your users are passing in.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.510
But for pure example purposes this works OK.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.670
Now with that being said what I'll need to do is get a reference to my element in the dorm so I'm going

01:50.670 --> 01:59.010
to do let's say left and we'll just call this div equals document doc queries selector.

01:59.270 --> 02:04.820
Well targeted by its class name da element and you can see that we have a reference to it now.

02:04.860 --> 02:09.120
Might as well go ahead and double check to make sure and you could see we do have a reference to the

02:09.120 --> 02:16.110
div and get rid of that called Serat log and now I'm just going to make a new variable called a custom

02:16.170 --> 02:26.660
l l and set the equal to new custom HMO element pass in the div like so.

02:26.820 --> 02:34.950
And now we can look inside of it if we want to so that you can sort out log custom as well.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.320
H.T. and now.

02:37.690 --> 02:44.080
So and you see we get access to the enraged him right here and if we want to we can set it to something

02:44.080 --> 02:52.960
else so what I might do is right Konst list and then do a template literal and then inside of here I'm

02:52.960 --> 02:57.910
just going to do an ordered list like so.

02:58.720 --> 03:07.950
And then after that I'm going to make some lies so you lie in an opening and closing tags like so.

03:08.180 --> 03:11.270
And then after that I can just copy this and then paste it.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.280
So I'll do one two three.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.570
Now we can add an alt shift one to three.

03:15.600 --> 03:21.120
So do a multi cursor and we'll do hello like so now that we have that set up.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.240
Don't forget your semi-colon like you.

03:24.270 --> 03:34.080
And then after that I can just do let's say custom l da HMO said equal to the list and then print out

03:34.080 --> 03:40.560
or get the same thing that we got before and as soon as I say this you're going to see it should instantly

03:40.560 --> 03:44.770
change cannot set property enter h T.M. undefined.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.850
Let's see what went wrong here.

03:46.980 --> 03:50.490
This element dot enraged him down.

03:50.580 --> 03:52.490
That should have worked ok.

03:52.890 --> 03:59.370
Custom l die each CMO equals list which should have passed in the list as a value and then assigned

03:59.370 --> 04:02.590
it to the inner HMO property.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.330
And in that case it didn't work.

04:04.330 --> 04:05.820
Let me see what went wrong.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.340
Line 124.

04:08.450 --> 04:08.810
OK.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.750
So we'll go back up.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.940
Oh I see I spelled element wrong.

04:14.000 --> 04:14.410
OK.

04:14.510 --> 04:15.710
There we go.

04:15.710 --> 04:19.460
Now you can see things instantly change to what they were before.

04:19.490 --> 04:24.120
First it prints it out as it is and then it instantly changes it to an unordered list.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.510
And this is how you would use getters and setters.

04:26.690 --> 04:28.850
All you have to do is write get in and.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.220
And you don't have to even separate them with commas.
