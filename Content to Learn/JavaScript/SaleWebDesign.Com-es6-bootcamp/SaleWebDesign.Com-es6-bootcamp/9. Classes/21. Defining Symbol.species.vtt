00:00.450 --> 00:05.990
Now each of these built ins has a symbol that species access or property on it.

00:06.090 --> 00:09.450
And basically what it does is it returns the keyword this.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.550
So in other words it always returns the constructor function.

00:12.570 --> 00:18.150
To illustrate this you were going to implement a very similar functionality on our own class so monologist

00:18.180 --> 00:22.950
commonalties cancelled out logs right here just so you can kind of see it more clearly.

00:23.250 --> 00:29.100
When we start logging things saw a new class and will call at my class and inside of here I'm going

00:29.100 --> 00:39.120
to do a static accessor property that will be called symbol symbol dot species like so and then inside

00:39.120 --> 00:44.430
of here I'm just going to return the keyword this which is the same as returning the constructor function.

00:44.430 --> 00:50.850
Then I'm going to define the constructor function with a parameter of value and set this value equal

00:50.850 --> 00:52.170
to value.

00:52.170 --> 00:55.680
And then after that I'm going to do a clone method.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.150
Now I'm going to explain the rhyme and the reason behind this in a second but just kind of type along

01:00.150 --> 01:01.110
with me for now.

01:01.380 --> 01:06.060
So what I'll do is inside of here going to do return.

01:06.380 --> 01:10.310
New this constructor

01:12.600 --> 01:21.760
brackets symbol dot species invocation pass in this stock value like so.

01:22.200 --> 01:22.720
OK.

01:22.830 --> 01:30.730
So essentially what this means right here is this dot constructor symbol.

01:30.750 --> 01:36.320
And I'm going to comment this symbol symbol dot species like so.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.270
This returns the class returns class.

01:40.330 --> 01:40.900
OK.

01:41.160 --> 01:50.790
So the reason that we do this is to basically be able to create an instance of our class inside of an

01:50.850 --> 01:56.670
instance method right here so this is a way for us to return an instance of the class and that's why

01:56.670 --> 01:58.800
we use the new keyword right here.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.310
Notice I didn't include the new keyword in this definition.

02:01.310 --> 02:03.320
This just returns the class in this case.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.660
We want to return an instance of the class so we add the new keyword right here.

02:07.710 --> 02:13.680
But the reason you would want to do this instead of using the constructor function directly is first

02:13.680 --> 02:20.440
it gives us the ability to create instances of this class from within an instance of that class.

02:20.580 --> 02:26.410
And on top of that it's very easy to override what class this returns.

02:26.550 --> 02:33.630
So in other words it allows us to do what we did up here which is to essentially override what class

02:33.630 --> 02:39.150
gets returned or what instance gets returned in this case and instead of returning the built in right

02:39.150 --> 02:45.960
here an instance of the builtin we return an instance of our own class whenever we invoke this instance

02:45.960 --> 02:46.350
method.
