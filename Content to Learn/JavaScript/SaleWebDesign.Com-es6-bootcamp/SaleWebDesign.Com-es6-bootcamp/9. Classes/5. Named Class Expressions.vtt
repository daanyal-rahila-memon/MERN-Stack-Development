Also as with function expressions with class expressions you can choose to do an anonymous class expression

00:06.930 --> 00:15.510
as we've done here or you can choose to give it a name like so you could call this person class to like

00:15.510 --> 00:16.160
so.

00:16.380 --> 00:24.030
And then after that if we go down here and we do let's say a Type Of Person class 2 you're going to

00:24.030 --> 00:25.680
see that it says undefined.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.190
So in other words this identifier that we gave our class expression only exists inside of the class

00:32.190 --> 00:33.050
definition.

00:33.120 --> 00:40.560
So that way our class methods can access it outside of this body right here outside of this class definition.

00:40.560 --> 00:48.210
This binding doesn't exist so that way you can't access it but you can access it from within this class

00:48.210 --> 00:48.830
right here.
