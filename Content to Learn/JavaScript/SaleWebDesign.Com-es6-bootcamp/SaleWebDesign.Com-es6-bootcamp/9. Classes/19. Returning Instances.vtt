00:00.570 --> 00:05.700
So I want to talk to you about something else that's very interesting when you're working with built

00:05.700 --> 00:07.590
ins and inheritance.

00:07.590 --> 00:13.500
So as you can see I have the same exact class right here and it's inheriting from the built in array

00:13.680 --> 00:14.500
right here.

00:14.670 --> 00:17.210
So something interesting happens involved.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.770
This symbol does species property that we're going to talk about later.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.490
But essentially if you use a method on your derived class that returns an instance it's going to return

00:29.490 --> 00:34.350
an instance of this derived class instead of an instance of the built in.

00:34.350 --> 00:36.840
So for example we'll go ahead and instantiate.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.770
So we'll do.

00:37.860 --> 00:38.540
Let's do a lead.

00:38.580 --> 00:44.570
This time we'll do let And we'll do re equals new my array.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.850
And we'll just pass in a couple of values like so.

00:48.090 --> 00:54.750
And then after that we'll just do a rate 2 and we're going to set that equal to a array splice and then

00:54.750 --> 01:03.860
1 through three like so and then we're going to do some checks so with you cancel or log array instance.

01:04.080 --> 01:04.870
There we go.

01:06.170 --> 01:08.420
My RE.

01:08.550 --> 01:11.440
And then we're going to copy this and do the same thing.

01:11.450 --> 01:14.060
So we're going to run this check against the second array.

01:14.070 --> 01:18.660
Now you can see that both of these are considered to be instances of my array.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.960
The reason that this is interesting is because we inherited this method from the array right here this

01:24.960 --> 01:26.250
built in.

01:26.250 --> 01:32.850
So whenever we call it typically it would return an instance of this built in right here.

01:33.030 --> 01:38.730
But since we're working with a class that is derived from it what it's going to do instead is return

01:38.730 --> 01:45.330
an instance of this derived class instead of Typically what it would do which is to return an instance

01:45.330 --> 01:47.190
of the built in right here.

01:47.190 --> 01:53.940
Now the reason that this is happening behind the scenes is because of this symbol dot species property

01:53.940 --> 01:57.510
right here and we're going to go ahead and talk about that in the next video.
