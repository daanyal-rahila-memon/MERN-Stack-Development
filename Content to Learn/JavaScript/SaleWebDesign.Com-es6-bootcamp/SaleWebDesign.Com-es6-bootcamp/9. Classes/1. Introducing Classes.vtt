As you can see here I'm working inside of a new file called classes dodgier.

00:04.890 --> 00:09.620
So if you want to go ahead and pausa and get this file set up and linked up to your index start aged

00:09.630 --> 00:11.450
you know feel free to do so.

00:11.600 --> 00:16.110
But that being said we're going to be talking about a new iOS 6 feature referred to as you guessed it

00:16.500 --> 00:17.250
classes.

00:17.250 --> 00:22.700
Now originally javascript didn't really have classes from E.S. one to S-5.

00:22.830 --> 00:29.460
Well not classes as you would typically find them in other languages like for example C-Sharp or something

00:29.460 --> 00:30.330
like that.

00:30.360 --> 00:36.020
Instead what you would often do is you would create a constructor function like this to function maybe

00:36.030 --> 00:46.140
person type and then give it a parameter of name like so and then we'll do this dot name equals name.

00:46.410 --> 00:52.980
And then after that you would assign things like methods to the prototype of this particular constructor.

00:52.980 --> 01:01.200
So do person prototype and then we can add something like say name and just said equal to an anonymous

01:01.200 --> 01:05.780
function and we'll just canceled or log this name.

01:05.910 --> 01:11.940
Now whenever we create an instance or we create an object using this constructor will do let's say Konst

01:11.940 --> 01:19.240
person equals new person type like so pass in a name like Ricky.

01:19.410 --> 01:25.170
You'll see that this method is actually available on all of the objects that we create with our custom

01:25.170 --> 01:25.500
type.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.290
So if I do say a name like so should print out Ricky as you can see right here.

01:30.510 --> 01:37.050
And a lot of people have created libraries over the years that kind of mimic how classes would look

01:37.350 --> 01:39.450
inside of other programming languages.

01:39.600 --> 01:45.210
Now a lot of javascript developers argue that you really don't need classes inside of javascript but

01:45.210 --> 01:48.190
whether you think that it should have them or should not have them.

01:48.220 --> 01:50.190
They are now available inside of iOS 6.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.280
So we're going to go ahead and look at how that works.
