You can also inherent static methods whenever you're working with derived classes.

00:04.880 --> 00:12.000
So what I'll go ahead and do is make a new static method that I'll call create and it's going to have

00:12.000 --> 00:19.050
two parameters a length and width as before and all it's going to do is return an instance of the rectangle

00:19.050 --> 00:24.920
class years so that the rectangle will just pass and the length and the width like so.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.290
Then after that this should be available on Square.

00:28.290 --> 00:40.070
So what I'll do is down here do Konst rectangle equals square da create like so and then we'll do it

00:40.070 --> 00:47.850
two by two and then I can just sort out log the rectangle like so you'll see that.

00:47.850 --> 00:51.780
Now I have this class or this object that has been created.

00:51.900 --> 00:58.920
And even though it's a static method we can still have access to it on this derived class due to inheritance.
