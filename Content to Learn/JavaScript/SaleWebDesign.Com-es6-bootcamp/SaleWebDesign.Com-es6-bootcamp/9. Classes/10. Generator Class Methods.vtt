00:00.520 --> 00:04.180
Now you can also create generator methods on your class.

00:04.180 --> 00:11.200
Very similar to what you would do with objects so for example what do class and will just do we'll just

00:11.200 --> 00:13.130
call it let's say.

00:14.260 --> 00:14.980
GEN.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.140
Yes.

00:16.270 --> 00:21.520
And then inside of here in order to make a generator method all we have to do is a star in the name.

00:21.520 --> 00:26.560
So in this case what does call it make iterator and then inside of here we can yield.

00:26.560 --> 00:32.060
So we'll do yield one yield two and then yield three like so.

00:32.200 --> 00:41.620
And then after that we have to first instantiate this class SOTY Konst instance equals nine new Djin

00:41.620 --> 00:43.560
class like so.

00:43.880 --> 00:53.320
And then we can take that instance and access the generator function on it which will then return this

00:53.320 --> 01:00.950
iterator right here and then we can cancel dialog iterator dot next like so.

01:01.010 --> 01:04.020
And as you can see it'll return our first result object.

01:04.030 --> 01:11.410
So what we did here was define a generator class method and then we hardcoded the results inside of

01:11.410 --> 01:12.520
that generator.

01:12.520 --> 01:18.910
Now generator class methods are useful if you have a collection like an object for example an object

01:18.910 --> 01:20.010
is a good example.

01:20.140 --> 01:24.040
And you're using that object has a collection to represent values.

01:24.100 --> 01:28.930
And of course different collection types like sets maps and arrays have a lot of builtin generators

01:28.930 --> 01:31.390
that you can use to iterate through them.
