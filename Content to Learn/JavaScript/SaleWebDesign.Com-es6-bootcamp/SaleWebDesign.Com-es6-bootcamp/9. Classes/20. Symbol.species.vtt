00:00.480 --> 00:07.950
So what is this symbol dot species that basically overrides the default behavior of this built in method

00:07.950 --> 00:14.010
right here and instead of returning an instance of the built in method returns an instance of this derived

00:14.010 --> 00:15.310
class right here.

00:15.390 --> 00:21.760
So what it does is essentially it's a static accessor property and it returns a function.

00:21.900 --> 00:28.170
It actually returns a constructor function and this constructor function is to be used whenever you

00:28.170 --> 00:33.470
need to create an instance of a class inside of an instance method.

00:33.480 --> 00:39.420
So right here this is an instance method and instead of using a constructor function which is what we

00:39.420 --> 00:45.210
would typically do we need to use symbol dot species in the function that it returns because we can't

00:45.210 --> 00:47.240
use a constructor function here.

00:47.290 --> 00:52.400
Now a number of different types have this built into it have the symbol that species on it.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.250
Ray Ray buffer which we haven't talked about.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.180
Matt promis regular expressions sets and typed arrays.

00:59.250 --> 01:04.080
We're going to be talking about a few of these in more detail later but for now just know that it's

01:04.080 --> 01:09.600
going to return a constructor function that we can use to create an instance of a class even though

01:09.600 --> 01:16.290
we are inside of an instance method that is a method that is on an instance of our class or on an object

01:16.290 --> 01:21.020
so we can still create another instance of our class from within the object.
