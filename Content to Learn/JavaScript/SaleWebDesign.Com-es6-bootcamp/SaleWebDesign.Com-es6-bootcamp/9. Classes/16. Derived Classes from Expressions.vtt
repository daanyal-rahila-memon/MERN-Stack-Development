Perhaps one of the coolest things about working with derived classes in javascript is that you can derive

00:07.380 --> 00:09.890
a class from any kind of expression.

00:09.900 --> 00:16.410
The only thing is whenever you derive from any kind of expression it has to evaluate to a function with

00:16.410 --> 00:18.330
a builtin constructor method.

00:18.330 --> 00:20.230
So for example what.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.380
Oh and also it has to have a prototype.

00:22.380 --> 00:28.090
So for example let's say I do a function here and we'll call it rectangle.

00:28.140 --> 00:34.020
And we're going to do the good old fashioned custom type syntax so will do length in a whit inside of

00:34.020 --> 00:41.700
here we'll set this length equal to the length like so and then we'll do this with and set it equal

00:41.700 --> 00:43.440
to the with business as usual.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.060
Right.

00:44.340 --> 00:49.310
And then on the prototype we're going to add methods so we'll do.

00:49.430 --> 00:50.360
Area.

00:50.670 --> 00:55.250
Now we're just going to set that equal to a function and inside of here we're just going to return this

00:55.530 --> 00:59.830
with times this length like so.

01:00.080 --> 01:06.990
And now what I can do is I can actually extend this expression right here so I can do let's say class

01:07.440 --> 01:17.130
square extends rectangle like so and then inside of here I might define my own constructor and pass

01:17.130 --> 01:18.780
in a length.

01:18.780 --> 01:24.780
Now remember here that whenever you're using your constructor inside of a derived class you need to

01:24.780 --> 01:29.410
call super So that way you're still invoking the constructor function of your parents.

01:29.410 --> 01:37.770
So in this case I'll just pass on length twice Lang like so and then after that I can come down here

01:37.920 --> 01:45.150
and we'll just instantiate it and make a new square and all we're going to do is pass in four whoops

01:45.210 --> 01:48.310
like so and then we can open up our con..

01:48.570 --> 01:52.990
Open that up and last but not least we will cancel the log.

01:54.290 --> 01:59.180
The square like so then it will reload.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.100
Take a second.

02:00.180 --> 02:00.980
And there you go.

02:00.990 --> 02:06.620
As you can see we did make a perfectly new object right here an instance of this class.

02:06.750 --> 02:12.480
And the reason I could extend this constructor function right here is because it evaluates to a function

02:12.480 --> 02:19.050
with a built in construct method and a prototype which is the requirement for extending any kind of

02:19.050 --> 02:19.610
expression.
