Being able to accept any expression after the extends keyword actually opens up a lot of powerful possibilities.

00:08.090 --> 00:14.150
For example what we could do is make another function called Get base right here and all that's going

00:14.150 --> 00:23.090
to do is return the rectangle function right here and then after that I can replace rectangle with get

00:23.090 --> 00:29.210
base and just call it and it's going to do is return and you can see it works exactly the same as our

00:29.210 --> 00:30.820
previous example did.

00:30.910 --> 00:37.370
Except now I can't actually programmatically determine the base function which opens up a lot of new

00:37.370 --> 00:38.700
possibilities for me.

00:38.720 --> 00:44.960
As far as inheritance goes by being able to dynamically determine what I want to derive from.
