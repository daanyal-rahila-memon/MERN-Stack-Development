While it is useful to define a generator method on your class it is much more helpful to define a default

00:06.900 --> 00:08.270
iterator on your class.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.060
And we can define default iterators as we talked about before by using symbol da iterator as a generator

00:15.060 --> 00:15.540
function.

00:15.540 --> 00:21.330
So what we'll do is make a new class and call it collection and inside of here we're just going to do

00:21.330 --> 00:24.260
a constructor like so.

00:24.510 --> 00:30.980
And inside of here we're just going to set this values equal to an empty array right here.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.390
And then after that we're going to do a generator function and will do symbol.

00:36.630 --> 00:40.130
Iterator we're doing a computed property right here.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.740
After that we're going to basically yield.

00:43.950 --> 00:49.210
And now what I want to do is delegate to the builtin iterator inside of an array.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.380
So what I'll do as a star again.

00:51.510 --> 00:58.350
And then do this values so now whenever I use this yield statement right here by calling this default

00:58.380 --> 01:02.840
iterator it's going to delegate to the iterator that's built into the array.

01:02.850 --> 01:12.720
So now whenever I go ahead and instantiate this concert collection equals new collection like so and

01:12.720 --> 01:18.780
then I'm going to push on some values collection push and I'm going to push this on to the items so

01:18.780 --> 01:25.430
I should do items a push then I can do one and will do the same thing again.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.540
It's a pull due to this time.

01:27.990 --> 01:34.630
And so now by default this generator method right here works with things like four of loops.

01:34.650 --> 01:47.370
So if I did something like For let item of collection rate here and then I'd just cancel it out log

01:48.220 --> 01:53.510
individual items like so let's say you cannot read property.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.610
Push of undefined.

01:55.610 --> 02:03.460
So collection of values I named it values that's why so values and then values.

02:03.470 --> 02:05.540
Now if I run through it you'll see that it works.

02:05.550 --> 02:10.910
Now whenever I try to use the for loop it's going to use the default iterator that I defined which then

02:10.910 --> 02:15.290
delegates to the default iterator that's built into arrays.
