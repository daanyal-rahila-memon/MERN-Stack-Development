Now in programming something is considered to be a first class citizen.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.860
If it can be treated as a value.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.230
So for example functions inside of javascript are considered first class functions.

00:13.410 --> 00:20.160
And so what that means is that you can pass functions as arguments you can return functions from other

00:20.160 --> 00:21.030
functions.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.640
You can even assign them to variables.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.280
Now inside of 6 they continue this sort of tradition with classes.

00:28.380 --> 00:34.170
And so as you saw with our class expressions we can assign them as variables and we can also even pass

00:34.170 --> 00:42.170
them in his arguments so for example if I do a function here and we'll call it make object and it'll

00:42.180 --> 00:53.180
take an object definition like so and then inside of here all it's going to do is return new def like

00:53.180 --> 00:54.240
so.

00:54.620 --> 01:00.740
And after that we can invoke the function and take what's returned and assign it to an object or to

01:00.740 --> 01:01.930
a variable I should say.

01:01.970 --> 01:04.180
So we can do make object.

01:04.220 --> 01:12.440
And here I'll pass in a class as the argument right here and all it's going to do is say hi inside of

01:12.440 --> 01:14.720
here soda's concert.

01:16.340 --> 01:24.680
Like so now whoops if I go ahead and actually access this method you'll see it's a job.

01:24.700 --> 01:31.010
They say hi and all it does is print out Hello right there so you could pass them in as arguments if

01:31.010 --> 01:31.680
you wanted to.
