00:00.830 --> 00:06.900
So armed with this new knowledge what we can do is I'm going to comment out all of this right here.

00:07.130 --> 00:14.030
And then after that I'm actually going to take the exact code that we wrote before comments it out go

00:14.030 --> 00:20.240
down to the bottom right here and we can actually override this default behavior which is right now

00:20.240 --> 00:25.820
whenever we use this instance method that's inherited from this built in it's going to return an instance

00:25.820 --> 00:27.350
of the derived class.

00:27.350 --> 00:30.750
Now we know that we can override that and use something like.

00:30.830 --> 00:42.200
I don't know static get symbol species then inside of here we can just return array like so.

00:42.290 --> 00:46.760
Now if I go down here if I can find my checks I know I added some checks in here.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.940
Yes right here.

00:48.950 --> 00:51.820
Like so pop down.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.630
Add that in.

00:53.630 --> 00:56.680
So uncomment those back in.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.980
You'll see that it is an instance of my array right here.

01:00.980 --> 01:07.040
This is an instance of Mirei but array 2 is not an instance of my array.

01:07.040 --> 01:13.960
So in other words I was able to override the actual instance of the class that gets returned instead

01:13.970 --> 01:16.340
of returning an instance of my derived class.

01:16.340 --> 01:22.260
I can now override it with symbol species and make sure that all of these inherited methods right here

01:22.520 --> 01:25.340
return an instance of the original built in.
