Another interesting thing that you can do with class expressions is you can create very simple singletons.

00:06.480 --> 00:11.540
Now there's more sophisticated singletons that you could create in six or in typescript.

00:11.700 --> 00:18.610
But essentially what a singleton is is a class that can only instantiate an object once and if you try

00:18.610 --> 00:24.330
and instantiate the object again or instantiate the class again it's going to return the same object.

00:24.330 --> 00:30.610
So the way you would do that is you would do something like for example Konst person equals.

00:30.720 --> 00:37.040
And now we're going to do new right after the keyword class and we'll leave it anonymous and it's sort

00:37.040 --> 00:44.140
of here we can have our constructor constructor which takes a name argument and then we'll just set

00:44.140 --> 00:48.590
it equal to the owned property of the instance right here.

00:48.760 --> 00:56.590
And after that we'll do say a name like we did before where we just Concordat log this dot name like

00:56.590 --> 01:03.460
so and then right after these curly braces we're going to do parentheses and we'll pass and some of

01:03.470 --> 01:06.670
them like Neco for example.

01:06.710 --> 01:13.790
Now we can do person da same name like so and you're going to see that it prints out neco.

01:13.810 --> 01:20.050
So by using the class keyword with the new key word we're saying that we immediately want to instantiate

01:20.050 --> 01:26.590
this class and then you see we use the parentheses here first to allow us to actually pass in arguments

01:26.590 --> 01:27.690
to our constructor.

01:27.790 --> 01:33.620
But secondly to actually tell javascript that we are immediately invoking this as a function.

01:33.760 --> 01:40.570
And in doing so this class can only be created one time and can only be instantiated one time.
