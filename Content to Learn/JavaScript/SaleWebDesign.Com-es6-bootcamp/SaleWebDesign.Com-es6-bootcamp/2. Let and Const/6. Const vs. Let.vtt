00:00.450 --> 00:06.510
So at this point you may be wondering if there are two different ways to declare a variable using either

00:06.510 --> 00:08.120
let or cons.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.260
Then when do I make a variable.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.910
And when do I declare a concert variable.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.760
Well first let's talk about the similarities between them.

00:15.810 --> 00:21.690
First similarity would be that if you have a block scope the block scoping rules explain to you before

00:21.690 --> 00:29.190
with LET also applies to conc So if I did something like Konst and then maybe tax rate like so and then

00:29.190 --> 00:32.760
set it to I don't know let's say point nine.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.990
And then after that I tried to access it.

00:36.330 --> 00:43.500
If I put it in a block scope you're going to see that this is going to be unavailable to me inside of

00:43.500 --> 00:44.520
the global scope.

00:44.520 --> 00:51.490
So now if I do cancel that log and then tax rate like so it's not helping me out tax rate.

00:51.510 --> 00:55.740
There we go.

00:56.180 --> 01:01.250
You're going to see that once again it's not available and it's going to say that it's not defined because

01:01.250 --> 01:02.330
it's in the global scope.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.980
So they're similar to each other in that way.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.800
And another way that they're similar to each other is you can't really do read declarations with Konst

01:09.830 --> 01:10.550
either.

01:10.550 --> 01:18.880
So if I do something like for example var name equals Andrew and then we'll do let this time age equals

01:18.930 --> 01:20.440
ninety nine.

01:20.480 --> 01:27.090
And then I try to do a concert name of John and a Konst age of 54.

01:27.170 --> 01:31.640
This is going to throw errors because once again these have already been declared.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.370
So those are the things that they have in common.

01:34.370 --> 01:41.300
The big difference between a variable and a variable is that whenever you're using a console variable

01:41.480 --> 01:43.260
you cannot reassign the value.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.370
So in other words once you said it cannot be changed.

01:46.400 --> 01:52.550
So if I did once again conc name said it's Andrew and then tried to override what I originally assigned

01:52.790 --> 02:00.170
going to throw an error but if I just change this to let us see that it will let me assign a new value.

02:00.180 --> 02:04.220
So now when I do a console log name it's just going to print out John.

02:04.220 --> 02:10.210
So that's the big difference with the variable you can continue to change the data inside of the variable

02:10.220 --> 02:12.520
or the data that the variable references.

02:12.530 --> 02:16.370
You could also change the data type but with Konst things are constant.

02:16.370 --> 02:20.020
So in other words that data that value is set in place.
