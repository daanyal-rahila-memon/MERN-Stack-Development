00:00.210 --> 00:06.750
However if we use the key word let to make our variables inside of javascript what's going to happen

00:06.750 --> 00:08.010
is a little different.

00:08.010 --> 00:13.730
So first we'll make a variable inside of a code block will do if true.

00:13.790 --> 00:23.700
And then we'll do our Neame equals Leroi like so and then outside of that code block we can Soldat log

00:25.340 --> 00:30.080
name it'll actually print out Leroi if things go as they should.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.120
Let me try and reload this one more time.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.110
There we go.

00:33.110 --> 00:34.540
You can see it prints out Leroy.

00:34.540 --> 00:40.400
So in other words this variable isn't being restrained to this code block rate here it's being restrained

00:40.400 --> 00:41.540
to the global scope.

00:41.590 --> 00:45.530
And so we still have it available to us whenever we try to access it.

00:45.530 --> 00:52.280
Now all I have to do is change the keyword var to the keyword list and you'll see that I actually don't

00:52.280 --> 00:53.790
have access to it anymore.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.950
And it throws a reference there.

00:55.970 --> 01:01.920
So by using the keyword let to make our variables we now have block scoping available to us.

01:02.060 --> 01:07.420
Meaning that this curly brace set right here is actually its own scope now.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.720
And this would apply to for example for loops as well.

01:11.780 --> 01:16.880
If you declared variables inside of four loops not inside the clauses that would be limited to that

01:16.880 --> 01:20.410
particular scope in any scope that's nested inside of it.

01:20.420 --> 01:28.160
Also true for things like functions so if you'd had a function that say check or let's just say hello

01:29.210 --> 01:40.570
and then after that we did let name equal in and we'll do Jim like so called Soldat log.

01:41.400 --> 01:52.060
Hi plus name and then say hello once again block scoping would also apply to this particular consulate.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.360
Log right here.

01:53.360 --> 01:59.510
So in other words whenever we have curly braces and we use the keyword left that is the scope of that

01:59.510 --> 02:01.240
particular variable.
