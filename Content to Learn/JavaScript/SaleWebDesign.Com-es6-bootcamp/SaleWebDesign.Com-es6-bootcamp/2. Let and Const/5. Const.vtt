The other type of new variable that you can create is something called a constant variable now a constant

00:06.690 --> 00:13.770
variable is essentially a variable that once you store a value inside of this variable that value cannot

00:13.770 --> 00:14.730
be changed.

00:14.730 --> 00:20.470
So an example of this might be something as simple as Konst age equals ninety.

00:20.640 --> 00:27.390
And then if I try to reassign it like what I would do with a typical variable or let's change it to

00:27.390 --> 00:32.680
something different 93 you'll see I get an error assignment 2 constant variable.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.590
So if I comment this out you'll see the error goes away because it's OK to assign it.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.290
Now with that being said that also means that you have to define the variable or assign it a value.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.570
Initialize it if you will whenever you declare.

00:48.570 --> 00:54.990
So in this case I'm missing an initializer in my conc declaration and that just means whenever I declared

00:54.990 --> 00:57.590
my variable I never assigned it a value.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.940
And that's why we have to assign it a value because once the value is set it cannot be changed.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.910
And so if you've never set a value then it's kind of just set in this floating space of being a named

01:08.910 --> 01:09.450
variable.

01:09.450 --> 01:12.350
But now you can't assign anything new to it.

01:12.450 --> 01:18.390
But those are constant variables variables that once you set a value to them they cannot manipulate

01:18.390 --> 01:18.850
that value.
