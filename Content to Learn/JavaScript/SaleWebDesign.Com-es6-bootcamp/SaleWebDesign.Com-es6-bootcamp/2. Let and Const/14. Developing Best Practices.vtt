Last but not least we'll go ahead and cover best practices now whenever E6 was originally being defined

00:07.520 --> 00:13.820
and mapped out there was kind of a wide held belief that by default you should use the variables and

00:13.820 --> 00:19.280
only use Konst whenever you're sure that you don't need the variable to change the value of the variable.

00:19.280 --> 00:25.790
I should say now the weird thing about it is as more and more people got their hands on six kind of

00:25.790 --> 00:31.730
the reverse happened and the best practice that really started to gain a lot of traction was to use

00:31.730 --> 00:33.430
Konst by default.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.560
And then only use less when you know that your initial value should change over time.

00:38.630 --> 00:46.160
And the reason for this is people the idea or the rationale behind it is that once a value is initial

00:46.190 --> 00:52.520
once a variable is initialized that value shouldn't change because unexpected value changes are a source

00:52.520 --> 00:53.280
of bugs.

00:53.330 --> 00:57.530
So it's definitely an idea worth exploring to use Consta by default.

00:57.620 --> 01:03.150
And then only use variables whenever you're sure that you want the variable or the value I should say

01:03.170 --> 01:04.400
to change over time.

01:04.430 --> 01:09.950
But with that being said that's pretty much it for variables in iOS 6 Let's go ahead and move on to

01:09.950 --> 01:10.900
some other cool stuff.
