00:00.650 --> 00:06.570
There's sort of a subtlety that comes with working with objects and using the conc key word.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.780
And to really kind of illustrate it's you.

00:08.810 --> 00:14.420
I'm just going to make one first saw make an object like before I would use var but this time I'm using

00:14.420 --> 00:20.890
Konst the name of the object in this case I'll call it person e was object literal syntax will write

00:20.900 --> 00:23.840
a name like Andrew seems like a solid name.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.630
And then after that what I might try to do is override it so I'll try to set person to something like

00:29.630 --> 00:30.300
an array.

00:30.470 --> 00:34.980
And of course this is going to throw an error because my constant has already been declared.

00:35.330 --> 00:41.540
But what might be interesting to you is I can actually override the name property and I could set it

00:41.540 --> 00:43.700
equal to something like Leroi.

00:43.940 --> 00:50.660
And then after that if I cancel it all log this person dot name you're going to see that I don't get

00:50.750 --> 00:52.790
any error at all it's perfectly fine.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.470
All it does is printout Leroi.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.760
So what's going on.

00:55.820 --> 01:02.240
Well this kind of illustrates a subtlety of the Konski word which is that it prevents you from modifying

01:02.270 --> 01:03.500
the binding.

01:03.500 --> 01:07.180
It does not prevent you from modifying the bound value.

01:07.520 --> 01:14.090
So if you remember from before how we talked about reference types all we're doing is preventing ourselves

01:14.150 --> 01:22.040
from modifying what this variable references right here which in this case is an object with one property.

01:22.040 --> 01:28.940
It doesn't prevent me from modifying the values defined within what this thing is referencing.

01:28.940 --> 01:34.880
So in other words whenever you're working with Konst in objects you can modify whatever is inside of

01:34.880 --> 01:37.320
it as long as you don't change the binding.

01:37.370 --> 01:43.910
As long as you don't try to override this object with a completely different object or an array or anything

01:43.910 --> 01:49.940
else like just a random string or something like that because if I try to do that like person equals

01:49.940 --> 01:55.600
a string I'm going to get an error because once again I'm trying to say change what this is bound to.

01:55.850 --> 02:01.740
And I'm not trying to change what is inside of the bound thing inside of the binding.

02:01.760 --> 02:08.240
So this also applies to arrays for example so if you make a contest with an array will do Konst array

02:09.170 --> 02:15.990
and then set it equal to just some numbers 1 2 and 3 or 3.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.490
There we go learn to count.

02:17.660 --> 02:23.860
And then if I try to do things like for example push things onto it like I'll push on a five or a four

02:24.410 --> 02:27.680
and then if I try to maybe cancel the log.

02:28.490 --> 02:32.720
And then after words I try to pop things off radar pop.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.100
You'll see I don't get any error.

02:34.130 --> 02:35.330
That's perfectly fine.

02:35.330 --> 02:40.940
I'm allowed to do that as many times as I want to with no problem because once again I'm not changing

02:40.940 --> 02:46.850
the binding I'm just changing values inside of the binding just a very important characteristic to keep

02:46.850 --> 02:49.190
in mind for whenever you're working with conc.
