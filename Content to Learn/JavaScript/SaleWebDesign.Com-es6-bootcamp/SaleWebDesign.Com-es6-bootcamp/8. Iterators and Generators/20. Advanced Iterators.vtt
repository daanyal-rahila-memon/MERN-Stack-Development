Now that you understand the basics of how to use things like iterators and spread operators and also

00:06.510 --> 00:12.570
a for loop Let's go ahead and make a new file and I'm going to call this advanced underscore iterators

00:12.690 --> 00:14.090
dot G-S.

00:14.280 --> 00:19.560
And then after that we'll go down here comment out the script tag and then we'll add in a new script

00:19.560 --> 00:24.480
tag like so with a nice sole source attribute advanced iterators perfect.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.300
And then we can do a concert or log this to see if it works.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.600
And it does work.

00:28.620 --> 00:35.310
So essentially So far we've learned how we can use basic iterator functionality and also how convenient

00:35.310 --> 00:40.860
it is to make them with generator functions and up to this far they are pretty useful but they can be

00:40.950 --> 00:46.050
even more useful when they're applied to something that's more advanced than just iterating through

00:46.050 --> 00:47.050
a collection.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.670
With the advent of iOS 6 we're able to use iterators in generators to accomplish some pretty interesting

00:53.670 --> 00:54.390
tasks.

00:54.390 --> 01:00.450
So what we're going to do now is Diven some of the more advanced use cases of these new features of

01:00.480 --> 01:01.110
javascript.
