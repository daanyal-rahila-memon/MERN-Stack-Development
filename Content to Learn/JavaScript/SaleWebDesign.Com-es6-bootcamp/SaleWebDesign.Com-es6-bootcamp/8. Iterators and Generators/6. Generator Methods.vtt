You can also have generator methods if you really wanted to.

00:03.810 --> 00:09.360
So for example we'll just do the same thing except we'll make an object this time so we'll do let RBJ

00:09.900 --> 00:18.390
object literal syntax and we'll just do let's say make it a Raider and we'll set it equal to this function

00:18.390 --> 00:19.220
right here.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.450
So just copy this.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.150
It's going to be the exact same thing like so.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.640
And in this case you can do that.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.310
There we go.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.920
And that works just as well.

00:29.040 --> 00:36.650
Or you could also do a concise method syntax so the way you do that is you just cut this out and instead

00:36.890 --> 00:43.650
all we have to do is put this in and get rid of the star and just do star.

00:43.650 --> 00:46.370
Make it a Raider like so.

00:46.650 --> 00:51.940
And that works just as well since we're not using the function keyword with this concise method syntax.

00:51.990 --> 00:55.980
We'll go ahead and put the star next to the name of the method instead.

00:56.010 --> 01:00.300
But other than that it works just the same and it is still a generator function.
