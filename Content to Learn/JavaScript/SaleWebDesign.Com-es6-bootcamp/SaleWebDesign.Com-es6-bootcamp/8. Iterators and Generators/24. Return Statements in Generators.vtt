00:00.550 --> 00:07.210
So we've learned how we can use both the next method and the throw method on our iterators to kind of

00:07.210 --> 00:13.430
control the execution flow inside of our iterators when we're working with the yield keyword.

00:13.510 --> 00:18.190
But since a generator is just a function we can also use the return keyword.

00:18.190 --> 00:24.760
Now we can use the return keyword to exit the function or we can use it to specify a value that we want

00:24.760 --> 00:25.730
to be return.

00:25.930 --> 00:31.270
So for example we'll make an iterator like so when do function or we'll do a generator function.

00:31.270 --> 00:40.870
So we do make iterator and then inside of here I'm going to do yield 1 and I'm just going to do a return

00:40.870 --> 00:44.430
statement and then I'll just yield to like so.

00:44.860 --> 00:47.300
And then after that we'll make it so we'll do it.

00:47.320 --> 00:53.140
Iterator equals make iterator so we'll return our iterator there.

00:53.150 --> 01:03.340
And if I do a canceled log iterator dot next like so and then I try to do this again so I'll copy and

01:03.340 --> 01:07.270
paste it like so and we'll try to do it three times.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.740
You can see the first time we yield one.

01:09.790 --> 01:12.300
And so we get a return value of 1.

01:12.460 --> 01:16.180
But then after my return statement it exits the function.

01:16.180 --> 01:21.760
So in other words we stop iterating and so every time that we try to yield something after this we're

01:21.760 --> 01:22.980
not going to yield anything.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.040
So we're not going to get to this next yield statement.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.750
It's going to tell the iterator and we're done.

01:28.750 --> 01:33.190
So now you're going to return undefined and done is equal to true.

01:33.190 --> 01:38.830
Aside from that you could also do something pretty interesting so we could say for example you notice

01:38.830 --> 01:43.980
how whenever we finish this iteration right here the value is set to undefined.

01:43.990 --> 01:50.710
We can also use the return statement to specify a value that we want to be returned whenever we're done

01:50.710 --> 01:51.760
with the iteration.

01:51.760 --> 02:00.390
So for example a move yield to up and then I'll make a yield 3 like so yield 3.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.290
Then after that I'm going to return

02:04.970 --> 02:08.190
final value like so.

02:08.260 --> 02:15.610
So now if I paste in another counselor or log in his Save You can see we yield our first three values

02:15.610 --> 02:20.620
in our iteration and then once we finish our iteration because done is true.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.750
You can see I specified a value.

02:22.750 --> 02:28.990
Typically if I don't have a return statement inside of here whenever the iteration is done then the

02:28.990 --> 02:35.890
value is going to be set to undefine but return is a way for us to pass in some final data or pass out

02:35.890 --> 02:36.680
some final data.
