Now another thing to keep in mind when you're working with the spread operator is you can use it as

00:05.400 --> 00:06.880
many times you want.

00:06.880 --> 00:11.460
So to illustrate that you I'm going to go ahead and comment out these council logs so that way it's

00:11.460 --> 00:13.880
not distracting when we log onto thing.

00:13.890 --> 00:20.520
So in this case I'm going to make let's say another ray and we'll call those big numbers right here

00:20.520 --> 00:25.050
and this will just be an array itself and this we'll have like crazy big numbers like eight hundred

00:25.050 --> 00:26.150
ninety nine.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.420
I mean obviously it's not that huge of a number but it's pretty big.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.890
And then we'll do small numbers which will also be an array.

00:33.990 --> 00:40.160
We'll do 3:33 try to put in an array of 33 44 55 like so.

00:40.230 --> 00:46.150
Then after that what we could do is we can make a new array and we'll call this one.

00:47.730 --> 00:55.230
Big array like so and all we have to do here is we could do for example a 0 and then for the next item

00:55.230 --> 01:05.100
we could do a spread operator and big numbers like so and then counseled out log and big array.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.530
And you can see it just adds it in order So first it starts at zero and then it adds the big numbers.

01:10.560 --> 01:18.540
And if I wanted to then I could add in my map like so then I could add in another number right here

01:18.540 --> 01:25.290
like 33 and then I could add small numbers like so and I'm just trying to illustrate to you that you

01:25.290 --> 01:31.420
can really use this as many times you want and then maybe you set right here like so.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.720
And this is going to be a crazy big array I'll have to move it up so you can see well there we go.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.970
So you could see right here we have our zero.

01:38.970 --> 01:43.950
Then all of our big numbers up to 33 then it has two different arrays inside of it.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.830
And then 33 again and the small numbers.

01:46.890 --> 01:50.520
And then after that we have our set which consist of 1 2 3.

01:50.520 --> 01:57.690
So since you can use a spread operator on any iterable it is by far the easiest way to convert one collection

01:57.690 --> 01:59.220
type into an array.

01:59.220 --> 02:04.980
You could also do things like for example take a string and convert it into an array of characters or

02:04.980 --> 02:08.890
take a node list object and just convert that into an array of nodes.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.380
Definitely very useful.
