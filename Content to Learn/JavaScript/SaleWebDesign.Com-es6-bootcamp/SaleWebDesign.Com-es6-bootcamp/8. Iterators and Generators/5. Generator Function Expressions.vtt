Like I said before generator functions are just functions so you can put them just about anywhere that

00:05.610 --> 00:07.410
you would put a typical function.

00:07.410 --> 00:12.600
So for example we can do the same thing we did before by making a generator function but this time we'll

00:12.600 --> 00:20.290
do let make it a re tour and then we'll do an anonymous function.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.160
And since we're doing an anonymous function before when we made our function we put the star right before

00:26.160 --> 00:27.130
the function name.

00:27.390 --> 00:31.860
But in this case since we don't have a function name we'll just do a star and then parentheses like

00:31.860 --> 00:34.730
so and we'll pass on some items.

00:34.770 --> 00:37.210
In this case we'll do the same thing we did before.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.870
And in this case we'll just loop through it with you.

00:39.890 --> 00:41.850
I was zero.

00:42.040 --> 00:48.580
Then while it is less than item's length then we'll increment I like soooo.

00:48.750 --> 00:57.100
And then we'll just yield the individual item inside of I are inside of items I should say.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.000
Perfect Now that we have that set up.

00:59.040 --> 01:07.290
Next thing we can do is make our iterator so what you let it to a tour equals make iterator like so

01:07.890 --> 01:08.710
and we're good to go.

01:08.710 --> 01:13.290
So now we could do the same exact thing we did before which was to basically just cancel that log this

01:13.740 --> 01:18.060
and you can see it should work like a charm cannot read property of length.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.010
Ah I forgot to pass in my array.

01:20.070 --> 01:20.890
That's why.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.420
So we just have to pass in an array to fix this one two three.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.500
And now if you say that you see it works just like normal.

01:27.570 --> 01:33.710
As a side note even though you can use a generator function expression you cannot use or you cannot

01:33.720 --> 01:41.510
create a generator function by using Aeros syntax so you can't do something like for example Star parentheses

01:42.030 --> 01:45.510
arrow function that unfortunately will not work.
