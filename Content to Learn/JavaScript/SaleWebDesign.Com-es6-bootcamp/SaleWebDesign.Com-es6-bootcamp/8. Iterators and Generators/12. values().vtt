00:00.520 --> 00:06.640
Now aside from this we also have another iterator and it's called values right here and as its name

00:06.640 --> 00:09.160
implies it's really just going to return the values.

00:09.160 --> 00:14.350
So what we can do is just switch out what we've already done here and just put values and then I'm going

00:14.350 --> 00:20.260
to copy this and then I'll paste it in for all these other spots right here with some control the command

00:20.260 --> 00:21.350
VI on the Mac.

00:21.490 --> 00:25.330
Then you can see it just returns the values as they're stored in the collection.

00:25.330 --> 00:29.910
So in the case of colors it just returns the values in the case of the cell.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.920
It just returns the values and in the case of the map it just returns the values and not the keys or

00:35.920 --> 00:38.000
the indexes associated with them.
