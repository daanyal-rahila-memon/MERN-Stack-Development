So generator functions are a very powerful feature of the specification because since there are functions

00:07.920 --> 00:13.920
they can be used anywhere your everyday function would be used because a generator function is a function.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.740
So you can put it inside of an object or an expression.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.160
However there's one thing to be said about the yield keyword.

00:20.160 --> 00:26.160
The yield keyword can only be used inside of a generator function directly inside of it.

00:26.160 --> 00:32.220
So if I put the yield keyword anywhere outside of this generator function it would throw an error.

00:32.220 --> 00:39.540
So for example if I comment this out right here and I decide to do items for each and then I'll throw

00:39.540 --> 00:49.230
in a arrow function like so and then I yield every individual item is going to throw an error or 90

00:49.230 --> 00:49.890
percent sure.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.870
Well uncaught Senate syntax error unexpected identifier.

00:54.030 --> 00:59.580
So the whole reason this is throwing an error is because it's a function that is not a generator function

00:59.880 --> 01:02.670
and is trying to take advantage of the yield keyword.
