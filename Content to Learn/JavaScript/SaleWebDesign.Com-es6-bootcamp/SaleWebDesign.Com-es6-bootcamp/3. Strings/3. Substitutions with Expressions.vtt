Know a substitution is essentially just a javascript expression which means that we can insert more

00:06.960 --> 00:08.430
than just variable names.

00:08.430 --> 00:13.260
We can actually do calculations since those are expressions we could do function calls.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.470
We can do all kinds of different stuff with this.

00:15.540 --> 00:20.800
And so it's a really cool feature that was added and also why it's one of the more popular features.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.010
So let's say we work at a store and we want to do something like for example the count.

00:26.010 --> 00:31.020
So we'll do let count is five and then maybe we'll do.

00:31.020 --> 00:35.910
Price is like 25 cents or something like that.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.520
And then will you let name is.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.860
Well that's a good one I would say.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.620
Well do.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.510
Or something like that.

00:45.510 --> 00:52.260
Now what I could do here is counseled log and I can put it directly inside of here but I'll go ahead

00:52.350 --> 00:55.940
and just write an output so you can clearly see it.

00:56.160 --> 01:02.400
So inside here template literals back to X like so and then I'm going to insert the name right here

01:02.400 --> 01:07.620
so the name your total is.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.770
And then inside of here I'm going to do a dollar sign.

01:10.770 --> 01:14.100
Now this dollar sign is for the actual output.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.770
It's going to be like dollar sign.

01:15.930 --> 01:22.330
And however much money shows the second dollar sign is for the substitution syntax right here.

01:22.530 --> 01:26.660
And inside of here I'm going to do parentheses.

01:26.660 --> 01:30.010
Count times price.

01:30.510 --> 01:31.310
OK.

01:31.710 --> 01:33.600
And then after that we should be good to go.

01:33.600 --> 01:40.800
So now I can just put my output in here output as soon as my text editor stops trying to fight me.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.450
And let's see I made a mistake.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.530
Output is not defined.

01:44.530 --> 01:45.010
OK.

01:45.030 --> 01:46.220
So I spelled it wrong.

01:46.230 --> 01:47.480
That explains it.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.370
Got to be careful with how you write things.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.870
But now you can see that it prints out normally.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.180
Your total is 125.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.720
Now if you're wondering about these parentheses right here it's very very easy to just take those away

02:00.060 --> 02:01.710
and you'll get the exact same result.

02:01.710 --> 02:07.560
Like I said before people will just use parentheses with things like operations or if they're doing

02:07.560 --> 02:13.170
comparisons just to really bunch things together and clearly show you what was meant to happen at what

02:13.170 --> 02:13.870
time.

02:13.950 --> 02:18.690
And with that being said I could put a space between these two dollar signs just to illustrate to you

02:18.960 --> 02:21.060
that they are two different dollar signs.

02:21.060 --> 02:27.540
One is a literal dollar sign for the actual output and the second dollar sign is for these substitution

02:27.540 --> 02:28.980
syntax that's required.

02:28.980 --> 02:34.050
So we can do calculations inside of here since those are just expressions we could do functions so for

02:34.050 --> 02:43.380
example function greeds and it'll be let's say let and then name inside of here and I can declare that

02:43.410 --> 02:48.750
no problem because some of the blocks scope of the function and that's referred to as lexical scoping.

02:48.750 --> 02:56.490
And then we'll do Jessica then Allaman to do is just basically return name.

02:56.730 --> 02:57.240
That's it.

02:57.370 --> 03:04.230
So iminent do in fact we'll just make this really simple and we'll just return the string directly like

03:04.230 --> 03:04.790
so.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.240
Perfect.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.440
Now that I have that should be good to go.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.430
And so now what I can do is cancelled or log.

03:12.430 --> 03:16.670
Then they'll do a template literal Hello.

03:16.890 --> 03:22.860
And then after the substitution call the function.

03:22.860 --> 03:29.130
Then after that a semi colon and you can see it says Hello Jessica and all we did was call the function

03:29.220 --> 03:34.620
in it returned a string which in this case would have just inserted it inside the string.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.040
Now with that being said I hope you enjoy this.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.350
I hope you see how useful template literals.
