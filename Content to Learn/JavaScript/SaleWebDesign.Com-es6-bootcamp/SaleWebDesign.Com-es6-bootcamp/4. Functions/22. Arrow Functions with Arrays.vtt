Now I want to show you how you might use aero functions within arrays so what we'll do is we'll make

00:05.790 --> 00:10.890
a brand new array and is just going to be a good old fashioned array of numbers so just do Gnome's like

00:10.890 --> 00:17.110
so and then we'll just said let's do three and then four and then a five and then a six.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.300
And that should be good.

00:18.300 --> 00:23.610
Now typically the way we might loop through this is to do something like Gnome's done for each and then

00:23.610 --> 00:28.920
pass in a function and then it gets an item passed in so we'll just call it.

00:29.220 --> 00:33.920
And then after that we might do something like for example return.

00:34.350 --> 00:40.350
Let's say the number plus five or something like that right now will typically work out the way we want

00:40.350 --> 00:41.030
it to.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.190
However another way to actually do this would just be to use an arrow function so we could do is Gnome's

00:46.430 --> 00:48.100
dot for each.

00:48.270 --> 00:56.400
And then inside of here we can just do numb and then arrow function knowm plus five.

00:56.580 --> 01:01.950
So I don't know about you but that looks a lot shorter to me and it applies the same thing that we just

01:01.950 --> 01:03.380
talked about here.

01:03.390 --> 01:09.480
Essentially we only have one argument or one parameter so we don't need parentheses for our erro functions.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.770
And then on top of that since we're just returning It's just a one line return statement.

01:13.770 --> 01:19.260
We can just add curly braces right here and get rid of our curly braces that we would typically have

01:19.260 --> 01:20.220
right here.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.750
Now obviously if we wanted to do something else like counseled not log this we might need to add curly

01:24.750 --> 01:26.760
braces like for example wrap it.

01:26.880 --> 01:33.720
And then after we wrap it we'll go ahead and just put this inside of cancelled out log and then if we

01:33.720 --> 01:39.780
actually specified that we want to print out the index to we would need to wrap this in parentheses

01:39.780 --> 01:43.230
because now we have more than one parameter like so.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.440
But either way it's just so you know how you might use these different arrow functions with things you

01:49.440 --> 01:50.180
already know how to do.
