All right cool deals and a comment back out this conditional statement right here and I'm going to comment

00:06.240 --> 00:10.800
back in the first conditional that we wrote with our block level function now.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.500
So far we've been using.

00:12.500 --> 00:19.110
Use strict mode inside of six which means that these functions I declare will be restrained to this

00:19.110 --> 00:21.680
particular code block scope right here.

00:21.690 --> 00:23.250
Now if I'm not using.

00:23.250 --> 00:26.020
Use strict mode inside of 6.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.770
A very interesting thing happened.

00:27.770 --> 00:33.630
So let me go ahead and take this and I'll bring it back up to where you can see it very clearly like

00:33.630 --> 00:38.730
so you're going to see that it says function and then function.

00:38.730 --> 00:46.260
So in other words if you do not have a use strict mode activated inside of six then what's going to

00:46.260 --> 00:51.120
happen is the function instead of being restrained to this block scope.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.510
Right here is going to get hoisted up to the closest enclosing scope.

00:55.530 --> 01:00.930
In this case it would be the global scope and that's why I can see that it's a function outside of this

01:00.930 --> 01:05.380
code block right here because it's actually being hoisted to the top of the global scope.

01:05.520 --> 01:11.250
Instead of being hoisted to the top of this block scope right here in this would also be true if I wrapped

01:11.250 --> 01:14.370
it inside of a function or anything like that.

01:14.370 --> 01:19.890
So an important difference to keep in mind if you're using use strict inside of us 5 it's going to tell

01:19.890 --> 01:22.410
you that this syntax is completely invalid.

01:22.410 --> 01:28.370
If you use use strict inside of 6 it's going to allow this syntax and also restrain your function to

01:28.370 --> 01:29.200
the block scope.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.490
And lastly if you do not have use strict mode activated inside of 6 it's going to hoist your function

01:35.550 --> 01:39.360
instead of to the block scope top to the top of the enclosing scope.
