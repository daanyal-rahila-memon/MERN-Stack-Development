00:00.710 --> 00:04.920
There's a couple of other interesting things I want to show you with the name property for functions

00:04.930 --> 00:10.810
so what we'll do is we will comment out the first function called do something and we'll comment out

00:10.840 --> 00:12.610
the second console log.

00:12.820 --> 00:16.100
And then we'll change the name of the variable to do something.

00:16.300 --> 00:20.980
And then after that instead of having an anonymous function I'm going to give it a name of do something

00:20.980 --> 00:21.800
else.

00:21.820 --> 00:27.760
Now if we print out the variable that we assign it to do something not name you can see that the name

00:27.760 --> 00:31.140
of the function property is actually do something else.

00:31.150 --> 00:37.540
So in other words whenever I use a named function expression that's going to take precedence over the

00:37.540 --> 00:42.850
variable that I assign it to knows a couple of other interesting things to be observed first.

00:42.850 --> 00:47.690
If I make an objects we'll just do curly braces and we'll make a get.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.940
So we'll do it better we'll do get.

00:49.960 --> 00:55.380
And then first name like so and then inside of here we're just going to return something.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.700
We can do any name.

00:56.710 --> 00:58.040
Dante is good.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.100
Why not.

00:59.110 --> 01:02.230
Then after that we'll make a good old fashion method.

01:02.230 --> 01:08.170
So do a greet and we'll set it equal to function like so.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.150
Now we're just counseled.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.900
Hello or hell either one.

01:13.900 --> 01:22.970
Now with that being said next thing we can do is we can obviously counseled low boby J dog greets dot

01:23.020 --> 01:29.200
name if I can spell name correctly and you're going to see that the name of the method is actually Greek

01:29.260 --> 01:32.320
because it's being interpreted on the object literal.

01:32.320 --> 01:37.740
Now to get access or to retrieve getters and setters we have to do a little more work.

01:37.780 --> 01:45.100
So we're going to make a variable and we'll call it descriptor and we'll say let's say Object get own

01:45.100 --> 01:51.190
property descriptor here we pass in the object and the name of the thing we'd like to retrieve in this

01:51.190 --> 01:51.950
case.

01:52.030 --> 02:00.420
Then after that we can cancel the log descriptor dog get and then die name like so.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.120
And now you can see it shows us get and then first name.

02:04.120 --> 02:09.340
So it does give us a little extra information about this particular method and it would also do the

02:09.340 --> 02:12.610
same for a setter so in this case it would show set.

02:12.610 --> 02:13.660
And then first name.
