Couple other things to be aware of when using the name property.

00:04.590 --> 00:10.500
So what I'll do is I go ahead and comment these out and I'll comment back in my do something function

00:10.890 --> 00:19.950
and then just under it all cancel out log do something and then I'm in a bind it like so now then I'm

00:19.950 --> 00:26.020
going to give it a name like so and you're going to see it prefixes any time I use a function with the

00:26.020 --> 00:29.790
bind method it's going to prefix it with bound.

00:29.790 --> 00:34.470
Now on the other hand if I use a constructor function it's going to be a little different.

00:34.470 --> 00:38.660
So in this case it would be a new function like so.

00:38.910 --> 00:44.100
And then after that I would give it a name and it's going to be anonymous.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.070
Now ideally I would wrap this inside of parentheses just to make sure that it evaluates before I access

00:50.070 --> 00:51.120
the name property.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.050
But in any case it'll be anonymous.

00:54.050 --> 00:59.270
And so whenever you make a function using the constructor it's going to be anonymous.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.320
With that being said this unnamed property is meant to give you extra information about your functions

01:04.650 --> 01:08.570
and it's not necessarily meant to give you a reference to the function.

01:08.580 --> 01:14.170
So the Name property may not be equal to for example the name we give our variable right here.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.860
This is just meant to help make debugging easier.
