In the previous video we learn that functions have two different purposes inside of javascript.

00:05.450 --> 00:10.250
The first one is to just call the function like we did here without the key word new.

00:10.250 --> 00:16.460
And then a read only method called Call will be invoked which will just execute whatever's in the body

00:16.460 --> 00:17.390
of the function.

00:17.480 --> 00:23.420
And that's why this not person right here is set to undefined because the keyword this is never set

00:23.420 --> 00:24.260
in the first place.

00:24.260 --> 00:29.780
And so if I reload this now I've set it up to where it'll check because whenever we use the keyword

00:29.780 --> 00:37.670
new the keyword this is set equal to an instance of the person of the newly created object based on

00:37.670 --> 00:39.940
this person constructor function right here.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.310
And that's why when we do this check to see if the keyword this is an instance of person.

00:44.330 --> 00:50.060
It works because the constructor function sets the key word this equal to the newly created object based

00:50.060 --> 00:53.570
on the person aka an instance of that object.

00:53.570 --> 00:56.020
Now with that being said this is not a perfect check.

00:56.030 --> 00:57.440
There is a way around this.

00:57.440 --> 01:06.020
What I could do is something like for example new person doc call and then I'll pass in person.

01:06.020 --> 01:10.970
And then after that I'll pass on a name like Michaux for example.

01:10.970 --> 01:15.300
And like so or excuse me I forgot to get rid of the key word new.

01:15.530 --> 01:18.280
And you can see this actually doesn't throw an error.

01:18.290 --> 01:24.110
I mean don't get me wrong not person is still set to undefined but in this case it doesn't throw an

01:24.110 --> 01:26.150
error because what I do with the call.

01:26.180 --> 01:31.220
As we talked about this function before is the first argument I pass in is what I would like to set

01:31.220 --> 01:37.760
the keyword this equal to which in this case would be person which is indeed an instance of the main

01:37.760 --> 01:39.520
constructor function right here.

01:39.680 --> 01:43.670
And then of course the subsequent argument is just the property I would like to set.

01:43.850 --> 01:49.550
But either way it doesn't throw an error because it technically passes this check even though not person

01:49.910 --> 01:51.440
is undefined still.

01:51.590 --> 01:55.550
So this isn't perfect so what can we do to make it better.

01:55.910 --> 02:00.860
Well there is a new property that we can use to check things and I'll show you that in the very next

02:00.860 --> 02:01.100
video.
