1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright now we're

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
ready to write our first JavaScript code. In order to write JavaScript code

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
here, we need a script element. There are two places

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where we can add a script element. We can add that here

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in a head section, or in the body section.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The best practice is to put the script element at the end

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of the body section after all the existing elements.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So here after h1 I'm going to type script

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and press tab. This is our script element. Now why did I

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
say that as a best practice we should put the script element here?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, there are two reasons for that. One reason is

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that the browser parses this file from top to bottom. So,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
if you put the script element here in the head section.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You might have a lot of JavaScript code there, so your browser might

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
get busy parsing and executing that JavaScript code, and it's one

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
thing to be able to render the content of the page.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So this will create a bad user experience. Your user looks at your web page

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
it's white or blank, while your browser is busy parsing

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and executing your JavaScript code. So that's reason 1.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The second reason is that almost always the code that we have

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in between script elements needs to talk to the

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
elements on this web page. For example, we may want to show or hide

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
some elements. So by adding the code here, at the end

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of the body section, we'll be confident that all these elements

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
are rendered by the browser. Now there are exceptions to this rule,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
sometimes you're using third part code that has to be placed

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
in the head section. But these are exceptions, as I told you before

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as a best practice, you should add your JavaScript code at the end of the body section.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now here, you're going to write the same code that

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you wrote in the last lecture, console.log,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello World. But we're

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
going to talk about this in a little bit more detail, what we have here is a

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
statement. A statement is a piece of code that expresses

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
an action to be carried out. In this case, we want to log

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
a message on the console. All statements

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in Javascript should be terminated by a semi colon.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What we have here in between single codes is called

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
a string. A string is a sequence of characters

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now in JavaScript we also have this notation, we can add

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
two slashes, and this represents a comment.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So here we can add some description to our code and this description

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is ignored by the JavaScript engine, it's not executed.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's purely for documenting the code, when you want to explain to other

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
developers why you have written this code this way.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You don't want to explain what the code does, because that should be clear in

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
itself. So here I don't want to write something like logging something

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
on the console. That's so obvious in the code, right? Instead we want to

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
explain why's and how's. So for this demo, I'm just going to add

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
a simple comment, this is my first JavaScript

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
code. Now save the changes,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
back in the browser, we need to bring the console back

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
up, so right click somewhere, and click inspect, or

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
alternatively, you can use a short cut, that is alt, command,

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and i, on Mac, or alt control I on Windows.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That brings up the console tab, if the console tab is not

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
immediately visible, make sure to select it here, and here you can see the Hello

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,066
World message.
