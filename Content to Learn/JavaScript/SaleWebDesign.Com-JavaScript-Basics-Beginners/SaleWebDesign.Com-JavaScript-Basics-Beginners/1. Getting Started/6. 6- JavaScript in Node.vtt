00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in the last lecture

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we executed this piece of JavaScript code inside of a browser.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this lecture, I'm going to show you how to run the same code

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in Node. So I'm assuming you have installed Node on your machine, if not

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
head over to nodejs.org and download the latest version of Node.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now if you're on Windows, open up command prompt, if you're on Mac,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
open up terminal, and head over to the folder you create earlier.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, in this folder we run Node, and pass the name of

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
our JavaScript file, that is index.js.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We get the same message on the console. So we can see node is

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
a program that includes v8 JavaScript

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
engine. We can give it a piece of JavaScript code, and it will execute that

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
code for us just like how we can execute some JavaScript code in a browser,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so Node is a run time environment for executing JavaScript code.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now let me show you a tip. Here in vs code

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we have an integrated terminal, so you don't have to explicitly

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
open up a separate terminal window. So here on the top,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
under the view menu, look we have integrated terminal.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Note the short cut here, that's the short cut for Mac,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
on Windows you're going to have a different short cut. So, select this,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and here's our integrated terminal, pointing to the same

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
folder where we created our files. So we don't have to explicitly

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
navigate to this folder. And here we can run Node

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
index.js as well. Now in this course we're not going to work with

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
node anymore, because Node is a completely separate topic, in fact

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I have a comprehensive course about Node with 14 hours of content.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So once you finish this course, if you want to learn about Node you can always pick up my Node course.
