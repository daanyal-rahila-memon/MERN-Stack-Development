00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this three minute introduction, I'm

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
going to answer four frequently asked questions about JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What is JavaScript? What can you do with it?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Where does JavaScript code run? And what is the difference between JavaScript and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
ECMA Script? So let's start with the first question. What is JavaScript?

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
used programming languages in the world right now. It's growing

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
faster than any other programming languages, and big companies like Netflix

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Walmart, and PayPal, build entire applications around

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
JavaScript. And here's the average salary of a JavaScript developer,

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the united states. That is $72,000 a year.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So it's a great opportunity to get a great job learning JavaScript.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can work as a front-end developer, or back-end developer,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or a full-stack developer, or who knows, both the front-end and the back-end.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now the second question, what can you do with JavaScript?

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
For a long time, JavaScript was only used in browsers to build

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
interactive web pages. Some developers referred to Javascript

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as a toy language. But those days are gone because of huge

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
community support and investments like large companies like Facebook

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and Google. These days you can build full blown web or mobile

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
apps as well as real-time networking apps like

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
chats and video streaming services, command-line tools, or even games.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's an example, the third question,

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
where does JavaScript code run? JavaScript was originally

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
designed to run only in browsers. So every browser has

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
what we call a JavaScript Engine that can execute JavaScript code.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
For example, the JavaScript engines in Firefox and Chrome

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
are SpiderMonkey and V8. In 2009,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a very clever engineer called Brian Doll took the

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
open source JavaScript engine in Chrome, and embedded it inside

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a C++ program. He called that program Node.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So Node is a C++ program, that includes Google's V8 JavaScript

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
engine. Now with this we can

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
run JavaScript code outside of a browser, so we can pass our

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
JavaScript code to Node for execution. And this means the

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with JavaScript we can build the back-end for our web and mobile applications.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So, in a nut shell, JavaScript code can be run inside of

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a browser, or in Node. Browsers and Node provide a

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
runtime environment for our JavaScript code. And finally the last question,

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
what is the difference between JavaScript and ECMA Script?

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Well, ECMA Script is just a specification, Java

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Script is a programming language that confirms to this specification.

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, we have this organization called ECMA, which is responsible

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
for defining standards, they take care of this ECMA Script

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
specification. The first version of ECMA Script was released in

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
1997. Then, starting in 2015, ECMA

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
has been working on annual releases of a new specification.

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So in 2015. ECMA Script 2015 which is also

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
called ECMA Script version 6, or ES6

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
for short. This specification defined many new features for

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
JavaScript. Alright, enough theory, let's see JavaScript in action.

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So every browser has a JavaScript engine, and we can easily

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
write JavaScript code here without any additional tools. Of course,

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
this is not how we build real world applications, but this is just for a quick demo.

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So open up Chrome, right click on an empty area and go

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to inspect. Now this opens up Chrome

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
developer tools. Here, select the console tab, this is our JavaScript

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
console, and we can write any valid JavaScript code here. So,

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
type this, console.log

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
put a single code here, and then Hello World

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Another single code to terminate,

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
close the parenthesis, and add a semi colon at the end. Now as you

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
go through the course, you're going to understand exactly what all this means, for now, don't

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
worry about it. So now, press enter, and you can see the Hello World

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
message on the console. You can also write mathematical expressions

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
here. For example 2+2 you get 4. Or

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
we can do something like this. Alert, parenthesis single code

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
yo. Enter and here's an alert.

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
In the next lecture, I'm going to talk about setting up your

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
development environment for writing JavaScript code.
