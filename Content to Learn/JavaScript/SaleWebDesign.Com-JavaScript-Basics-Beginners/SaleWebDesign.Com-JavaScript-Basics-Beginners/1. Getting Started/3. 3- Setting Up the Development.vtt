00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order to write JavaScript code you need

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a code editor. There are various code editors out there including

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Visual Studio Code or VSCode, Sublime Text,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Atom, and so on. Out of these, my favorite is visual studio.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Code that we can download from code.visualstudio.com.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's a very simple, lightweight, cross platform and

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
powerful editor. So if you don't have visual studio code on your machine, go

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
ahead and download it, the other thing I want you to install is Node.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can download node from nod.js.org.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now technically you don't necessarily need Node to execute JavaScript.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Because as I explained before, you can execute JavaScript code inside

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of a browser or in Node. But it's good to have Node on your machine

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because we use that to install third party libraries and also

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
later in this section I'm going to show you a preview of Node. So,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
pause the video now, and download Visual Studio Code as well as Node.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Once you're done, come back and continue watching.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Alright, now I want you to create a new folder,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
call that js-

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
basics, the name doesn't really matter, we just want to have a folder

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for writing all the code in this course. Now, drag and drop

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
this folder into Visual Studio Code.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Okay? We've got this folder open, let's add a new file here,

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
index.html.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now you don't really need to know Html in order to take this course. But if you want to

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
be a front-end developer you should know your html well. Now in this

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
file, I want you to type an exclamation mark and then press

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
tab. This generates some basic html boiler plate,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we don't really care about any of this code here, we're going to use this as a

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
host for our JavaScript code. You're going to see that in the next lecture, so,

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
save the changes, now, open the

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
extensions tab here. Here in this box,

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
search for live server.

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So live server is a very light weight web server

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that we're going to use to serve our web application.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So install this, then you will have to restart visual studio code,

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when you're done, go to the explorer tab,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
write click index.html and select

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
open with live server.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This will open up Chrome, or your default browser, and point it

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to this address. That's where our web application is served from.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now currently we have an empty page, to make sure everything is working

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
properly, let's go back to visual studio code,

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
here in the body section, let's add an h1,

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
press tab and type hello world. Now

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
save the changes, back in the browser, you can see this page

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is refreshed automatically and we've got the Hello World heading here.

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In the next lecture, you're going to write your first JavaScript code.
