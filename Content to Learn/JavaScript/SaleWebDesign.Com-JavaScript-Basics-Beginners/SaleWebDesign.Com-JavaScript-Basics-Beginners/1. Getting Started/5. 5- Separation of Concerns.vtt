00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now while we can

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
easily write JavaScript code in between the script element, in a real

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
world application, you have 1000 maybe even a million lines of code, we don't want to

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
write all that code in line here. We want to extract and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
separate our JavaScript code from our html code. Let me give you a

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
metaphor. Think of your house. In your bedroom you have your

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
bed, and your clothes, you don't store your clothes in the kitchen. This is

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what we call separation of concerns. You have the same principle

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in programming so we want to separate html which is all about content,

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from JavaScript which is all about behavior. How should

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
your web page behave, what should happen when we hover our mouse

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
over a given element? Maybe something should pop up maybe something should be hidden,

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so we use JavaScript to implement behavior. So,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
open up the explorer window, add the new file,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
call it index.js.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, back in index.html, cut all this

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
JavaScript code here, and then paste it in index.js,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
now in this simple application we have a single

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
file, a single JavaScript file, in a real world application we have hundreds or even

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
thousands of JavaScript files. Later in the course you will learn how to

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
combine these files into a bundle, and serve that bundle into the client.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, save the changes, back in index.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
html, now that all our JavaScript code is in a separate file

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we need to reference that file here. So,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
let's add an attribute here, src, which is short for src,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and set it to index.js.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So this tells the browsers that our JavaScript code

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is now in index.js save the changes

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
back in the browser, you can still see the Hello World message

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and that confirms that our code is still working. In the next lecture,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we're going to execute this code in Node.
