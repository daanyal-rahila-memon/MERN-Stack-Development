1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
second exercise is pretty easy, it's just to help you get used to the syntax.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I want you to create a circle object using the

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
object literal syntax. Now this object should have a

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
radius property that we can read or write to, for example, we can set

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
circle.radius to 2, we should also have

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
an area property that is read only. So we should not be able to set

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the area from the outside but we should be able to read it.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For example, we can do a console.log of circle

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
.area. So, spend a couple minutes on this exercise,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you can see my solution next.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, so let's declare

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a circle object. We can give it a radius

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
initially, now to create a read only property,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we need a getter. So we use the get keyword,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
here's the name of our property, but actually it's implemented as

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a method. Now here we need to return math

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
.PI times this.radius

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
times this.radius. Okay?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And finally we can do a console.log of

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
circle.area, save the changes,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so this is what we get if we change radius to a new

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
number, and then read the area

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we get something different, but we cannot set the area from the outside.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because this is a read only property, we don't have a setter here.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now to prove this, even though here I set the area to 20,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
if I read it again, you can see it has the old value

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that is computed based on this formula.
