00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So you have

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
learned a little bit about functions in JavaScript, in this section, we're going

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to examine functions in more detail. So I'm going to start

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
defining a function called walk and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
here we do a console.log of

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
walk. What we have here is what we refer to as

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a function declaration.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But in JavaScript there is another way to define a function,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and that is using a function expression. So

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we start by declaring a variable or a constant

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
give it a name like run and then we set that to

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a function. So just like we can set a variable to

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a number, or a string, or an object,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we can also set it to a function. And you know that in JavaScript

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
functions are objects. So setting the

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
variable to a function is similar to setting it to an object, okay?

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And at the end here we need to add a semi colon, because when

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ever we declare a variable or a constant, we terminate this statement,

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
with a semi colon. So here's another example. We set x to 1,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and terminate it with a semi colon. In contrast,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we don't put the semi colon when we define a function using the function

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
declaration syntax, it doesn't really matter, so if you run this code

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
you're not going to get any errors, but by convention, we don't do

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this. So that's one difference between function declarations and

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
function expressions. Now, let's do a console.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
log, of run here.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So basically here we have defined a function, and this function

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
does not have a name. Its syntax is very similar to what

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we have in a function declaration, except that here we don't have a name,

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we can give it a name and then we would refer to this as

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a named function expression. Or we can exclude

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the name and with this we have

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
an anonymous function expression. So we have defined

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
an anonymous function that doesn't have a name, and set run

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to reference that function. So now we can call that

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
anonymous function using this reference.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Just like how we call a function in JavaScript. So, save the changes,

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and we get the run message on the console. Now we can declare

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
another variable, call it move, and set it to

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
run. So now both move and run are

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
referencing the same anonymous function, which is one object

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in memory. So we can call that anonymous function using

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
this other reference. So if we call move,

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we get the same result. So to recap, in JavaScript

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there are two ways to define a function, we can use the function declaration

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
syntax, or function expression which basically

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
involves declaring a variable or a constant

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and then setting it to a function. In the next lecture,

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we'll look at the key difference between a function declaration, and a

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.800
function expression.
