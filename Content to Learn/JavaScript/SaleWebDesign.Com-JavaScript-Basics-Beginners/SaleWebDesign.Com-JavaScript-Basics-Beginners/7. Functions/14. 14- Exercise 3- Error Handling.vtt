Earlier

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the course, in the section about arrays, we had this exercise

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to count the number of occurrences of a given element in

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
an array. So this is the solution that we wrote for this exercise, if you

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
don't have this, download the source code for all the exercises for this course,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you can find this at the beginning of the course in the first section.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, in this project if you look, in the arrays folder,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the 5th exercise countOccurances, so

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
copy that code into index.js to use for this exercise.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, this function has a tiny problem. Here we

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are assuming that the first argument is a valid array.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What happens if we call this function with a boolean?

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We get this error, uncaught type error,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
array.reduce is not a function. Because here we're calling array.reduce

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and booleans don't have this reduce method.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The same happens if you pass null or undefined,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or number. When we pass null we get a different error, cannot read

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
property reduce of null. So here we need to modify this function

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and add error handling. So this is what I want you to do for this exercise.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If this first argument is not an array,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I want you to throw an exception, then wrap these two lines,

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
with a try catch block, we can also wrap these entire

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
three lines altogether in a try catch block, it doesn't really matter

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
one of these lines is going to throw an exception, that is the second line,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
call to. countOccurences function. So there catch the exception

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and log it on the console. Again, very simple exercise,

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it just helps you get used to working with exceptions. You will see my solution

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
next.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So in this function, first we need

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to validate the first argument. Earlier you learned about array

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
.isArray method, so we can pass this first argument

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
here, and if this is not a valid array,

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we want to throw an exception. So throw new error

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
invalid array. We can add

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
any error messages here, it doesn't really matter. Now, we want

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to wrap this code in the try catch block. So,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
try we put these three lines there,

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then catch, here we add an

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
identifier for our exception, the error object that we are throwing

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
here, we get that and display

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it's message property on the console.

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Save the changes, and here's our error message.
