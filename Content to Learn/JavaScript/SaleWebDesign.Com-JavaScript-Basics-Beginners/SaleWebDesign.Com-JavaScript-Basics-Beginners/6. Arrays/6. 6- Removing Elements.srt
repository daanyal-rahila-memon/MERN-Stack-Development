1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright now

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
let's see how we can remove elements from an array. So,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
start by declaring a new array, numbers, and we

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
set this to 1, 2, 3, 4. Earlier

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in this section you learned about 3 methods to add new

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
elements to an array. You learned about the push method,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which we use to add something at the end of an array.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You learned about the unshift method that we use

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for adding elements at the beginning of an array, and the splice method

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that we use for adding an element somewhere in the middle. Now,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
when it comes to removing an element, again we can remove an element from

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the End, from the beginning and

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
from the middle. Middle. But instead of

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the push method, we use the pop method. This will remove the

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
last element in this array and return it. So let's

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
store that in a constant called last. And

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
here I'm going to do a console.log of numbers, so you can

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
see the array after we've popped the last element. And also I'm going to show you

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this last element. Save the changes. So,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
here's our array, 1, 2, 3, and you can see the last element is

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
4. Now, if you want to remove an element from the

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
beginning you use the shift method. Similar to the

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
pop method this will return the element that was removed.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, we can store that in first, and

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
let's have a look here, save the changes.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So the first element is 1, now if we log numbers

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we only have 2 and 3. Pretty easy. And finally

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the splice method you learned about earlier, so

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
if you want to remove an element somewhere in the middle

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you pass the index of that element. So let's say we want to

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
remove these three here. The index of this element is

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
2, so we pass 2 here, and as the second argument,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we pass the number of elements we want to delete.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We can remove 1 element, and then

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
let's log this on the console, numbers, save the changes

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
actually the result is confusing, so I'm going to comment out,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
these two lines so we work with our original array,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
let's have a look, so let's note that three is removed

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we have 1, 2 , and 4. Now if you want to delete multiple

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
elements, you pass a value greater than 1. So you can delete

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
2 elements, starting from index 2.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Save the changes, so 3 and 4 are removed and we only have

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
1 and 2. So, to recap, use the

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
pop method to remove the last element, use the shift method to remove the first

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
element, and the splice element to remove an element somewhere in the

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,033
middle of an array.
