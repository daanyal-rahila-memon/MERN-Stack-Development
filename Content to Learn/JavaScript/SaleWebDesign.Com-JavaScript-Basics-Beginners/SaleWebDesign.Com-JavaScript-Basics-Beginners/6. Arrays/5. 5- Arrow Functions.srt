00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the last

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
lecture you learned about this predicate function that we passed

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
on the find method. In ES6 there is a shorter

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
cleaner way to write the same code using arrow functions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So whenever you want to pass a function, as a callback function or as an

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
argument for a different method, you can use the arrow function syntax.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's see how that works. So,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you remove the function keyboard, and to separate the parameters

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of this function from it's body with a fat arrow,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in between them. This is what we call an arrow function.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now if your function has a single parameter, we can also get rid of

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the parenthesis, and this makes your code cleaner, you're removing the

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
noise in the code. If you don't have any parameters, you have to

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
pass an empty parenthesis. In this case we have a single parameter

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so I'm going to bring that back, and finally

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if you're function is a single line of code and is returning

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a value, we can male this code even shorter. First

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you get rid of the return keyword, and then you remove

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the curly braces, like this. And finally you can put everything

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
on one line. So here's the end result.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You read this expression as course goes to

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
course.name equals a. So basically we are

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
finding a course with the name equal to a.
