00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this section, we're going to take a detailed look

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
at arrays. You're going to learn all kinds of operations that you can

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
perform on arrays, such as adding new elements to an array, finding

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
elements, removing them, splitting and combining arrays and

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so on. These operations are extremely important in programming,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
especially if you are starting out, so make sure to watch every lecture

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and do the exercises that I have designed for you at the end of this section.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.366
So now, let's get started.
