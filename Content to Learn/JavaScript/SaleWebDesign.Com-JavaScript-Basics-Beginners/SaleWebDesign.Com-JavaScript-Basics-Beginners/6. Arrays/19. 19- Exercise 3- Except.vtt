00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright here's the

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
third exercise. So we have this numbers array, and a functon

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
called except that takes an array and another

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
array and in this array we can add the values we want to be excluded

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
from the original array. So this function returns a new array,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
without the values that we have passed here.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So if you run this program, we get a new array,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
with these three values, 2, 3, 4, because we excluded 1.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Note that it doesn't matter how many 1's we have here so I can add

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a couple more 1's and we still get the same result.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Or we can add multiple values here, so let's say we want to exclude

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
1 and 2, so as a result we get 3, and

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
4. So get started, you will see my solution next.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Alright here we need to

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
declare an array called output and initialize it

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to an empty, this is what we're going to return from this function.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now we need to iterate over this original array,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and for each element we have to see if that elements is

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in this other array. If it's not then we'll add that

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
element into this new array. Okay? So,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
for let element of array.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We iterate over the original array, now, we

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
should see if this excluded array includes

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this element. So basically we are checking to see if the

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
current element is in the excluded array.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If it's not, so we apply the not operator,

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
then we'll add this element into our output array. So,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
output.push element.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And finally we'll return output.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So save the changes, if you exclude 1 and 2 here,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we'll get 3 and 4, if we exclude all numbers, 3

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and 4, we'll get an empty array.
