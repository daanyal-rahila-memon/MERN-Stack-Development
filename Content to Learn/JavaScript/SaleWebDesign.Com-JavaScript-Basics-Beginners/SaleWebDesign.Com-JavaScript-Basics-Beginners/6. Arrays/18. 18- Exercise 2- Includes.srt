00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright now

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
our second exercise. So here we have an array of numbers, you have seen

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
includes method before. So console.log

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
numbers.includes. With this method we can check to see

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
if a given element exists in the array. Now,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
your exercise is to write a function like

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the includes method. So imagine we don't have this method in arrays, your

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
job is to implement this method yourself. So, I want you to

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
create a function called includes

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that takes an array and a search element.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we have the search element in the array we should return true, otherwise we should

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
return false. So, pause the video, do the exercise,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and when you're done come back and continue watching.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright so here we need to iterate over

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
this array. If you find an element that equals the search

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Element we're going to return true, otherwise we're going to return false.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Very very easy. So, for, we're going to use the

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for of loop. So for let element of

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
array, now if element

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
= the searchElement,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we're going to return true, so we don't need to search

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the rest of this array, we immediately returned true. Otherwise we get

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to this point that means we didn't find this element in the array, so,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we return false. Now let's test this.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, I'm going to call the includes function,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
pass our numbers array, as the first argument.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And 1 as the second argument. Obviously we have these numbers

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so we get true, but if we pass -1 we get

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
false.
