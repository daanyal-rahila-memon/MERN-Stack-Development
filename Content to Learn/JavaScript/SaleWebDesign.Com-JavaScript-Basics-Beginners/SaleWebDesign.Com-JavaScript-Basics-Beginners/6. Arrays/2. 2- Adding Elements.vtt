1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright let's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
start by declaring a constant called numbers

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we set this to an array with two elements, 3 and 4.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now note that here I've declared numbers

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as a constant, that means we cannot reassign

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
numbers to something else, if we do this,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we get this error assignment to constant variable, however

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's perfectly fine to modify the content of this array.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can add new elements, or remove existing elements. So constant

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
does not stop us from modifying the content of an array.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Okay? So, earlier you have learned that arrays

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
are objects, so using the dot notation,

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we can look at all the properties and methods defined

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in arrays. In this lecture, we're going to look at 3 of these methods,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so add new elements to the end

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
beginning or middle of an array.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The first method we're going to use is the push method.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, numbers.push

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we can pass 1 or more arguments, and these arguments will be

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
placed at the end of this array. So I'm going to pass 5 and 6

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
now let's do a console.log

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
of numbers, save the changes,

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so we have 3 and 4, now we have 5 and 6 at the end. If you

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
want to add elements to the beginning of an array, you use the

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
unshift method. Let me show you. So, numbers

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
.unshift. This basically pushes the elements

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in this array to the right, and adds new elements in the beginning.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, again here we can pass one or more arguments, I'm going to pass

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
1 and 2, now let's bring this console

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
.log down, and by the way to do this, we can hold down the

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
alt key, and press the up or down arrow.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's a good tip to know. So save the changes, now we have

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
1 and 2 at the beginning of this array. And finally if you want to add

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
elements to the end of an array, you use the

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
splice method. So let's bring this down,

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
numbers.splice, with this method

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we can go to a given position, and add new elements or

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
remove existing elements. Later in this section, we're going to look at removing

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
elements, so for now don't worry about that. Now look at the parameters of this

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
method. The first parameter is a start, which is a number.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So that's our starting position. So let's say in this array,

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
after 1 and 2 here, between 2 and 3, we want to add a new

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
element. So our starting position is here.

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What is the index of this element? Well you know that arrays are

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
0 index. So the index of the first element is 0

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and 1 and here's 2. So our starting position, or starting

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
index is 2. Now look at the second parameter

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
here, that's delete count which is a number. How many

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
elements do we want to delete? In this lecture, none. So I'm going to pass 0

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and then look at the third parameter. That's the items

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you want to add. So, to make this stand out, I'm going to add 2

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
characters here. a and b. Save

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the changes. So note that a and b are placed

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.033
after 1 and 2.
