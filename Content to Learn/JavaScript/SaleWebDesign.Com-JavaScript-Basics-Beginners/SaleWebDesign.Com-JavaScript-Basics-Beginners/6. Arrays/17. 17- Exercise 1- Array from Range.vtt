Alright so we have

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
covered a lot about arrays, now it's time for some exercises.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here's our first exercise. I want you to write a function called

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
arrayFromRange. This function should take two parameters

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
min and max and this is how we can use this function.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So when we run this program, we get an array, and in this

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
array we have numbers from 1 to 4, as you can see here. We can also

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
pass a negative number here let's say from -10 to

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
-4. So, we'll get an array like this.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So pause the video, spend 5 minutes on this exercise, and

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when you're done, come back and continue watching.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Alright, so, I'm going to define a function

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
called arrayFromRange, with min and

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
max parameters. Here, first we should create an

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
empty array, so let's call that output,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and set it to an empty array. Now we need a for loop

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to generate numbers between min and max. So,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for let i =

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
min. As long as i is less than or equal to max

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we're going to increment i and then push this

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
i into our array. So output.push

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
i. And finally, we return

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
this output. Now let's test this. So, save the changes

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
with -10 and -4, these are the numbers we

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
get, if you pass a positive number like 1 to 4,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
here's the output, if the maximum value that

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you supply is less than the minimum, you get an empty array.
