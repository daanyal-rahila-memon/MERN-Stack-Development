00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's take a look at the ternary

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or conditional operator, which is one of my favorite operators in JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's imagine we want to implement a rule like this.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If a customer has more than 100 points,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
they are a gold customer

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
otherwise, they are a

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
silver customer, how do we implement this?

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, first I want to start by declaring a variable

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to keep track of the number of points. So, let points

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we send that to let's say 110, now we want to

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
declare another variable called type that represents the

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
type of customer, and here is where we use the ternary or

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
conditional operator. So this is how it works, first

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we start with a condition. We want to compare the number of points

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with hundred, so we use the comparison operator here,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
points greater than 100. Now as you

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
learned earlier, this expression produces a boolean.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So the result of this expression is either true or false.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now depending on the result, we're going to set this

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
type variable to a different value. So here we

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
add a question mark, now if this expression

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
value is to true, that means this is a gold customer, so

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we want to set type to gold.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Otherwise, if this expression devalues to false, we want

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to set the type to silver.

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So this is the ternary or conditional operator, to start

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with a condition, if that condition evalues to true, we use

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
this value, otherwise we use this other value.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, let's log type on the console,

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
save the changes, so we have a gold customer,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in contrast, if I change the number of points to

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
90, and save the changes, we get a silver customer.
