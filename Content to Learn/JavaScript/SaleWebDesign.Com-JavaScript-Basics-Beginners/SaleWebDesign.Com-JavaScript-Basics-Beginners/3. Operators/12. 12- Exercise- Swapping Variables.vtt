00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright let's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
finish this section with a simple programming exercise. Let's declare

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
2 variables, and set it to red, and

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
b, set it to blue. Now when we log

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
these on the console, obviously we're going to get

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
red and blue. Right? Now what I want you to do,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is to write some code here to swap the value of

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
these two variables. So when we log these on the console, instead of

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
getting red and blue, we're going to get blue and red. So pause

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the video, spend a couple of minutes on this exercise, when you are done come

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
back and continue watching.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Alright to swap the value of two variables we

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
need a third variable. So we're going to declare another variable

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
let's call it c, we're going to use that as a backup.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So whatever you're storing in a, we're going to put that in

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
another variable that is c, then we're going to copy b to a

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and finally what we have in c, which was the value of a before

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we're going to copy that to b. Let me show you.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So we declare c, and set it to a.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So what we have in a which is red will be copied to c.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now we want to overwrite a with b. So we set

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a to be. The value of b is copied to a, now

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
both these variables at this point are blue. Finally

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we're going to copy what we have with c which is the

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
original value of a, we're going to copy that to b. So we set b

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to c, now, when we save the changes, instead of

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
red and blue we're going to see blue and red. So this proves

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that we have swapped the value of these two variables. Now if you

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
couldn't do this exercise, don't worry, this is because you have not trained

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
your programming brain. And this requires a bit of time. Just like some

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
one who wants to go to the gym, they are not going to build muscle on day 1.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It requires time and effort. Now to help you train your programming brain,

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I have designed lots of exercises for you in this course, so,

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as you go through these exercises and look at my solutions, you'll start to

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
pick up some patterns and techniques to solve programming problems.

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So once again, if you're going to do this exercise, don't be disappointed, that's perfectly fine.
