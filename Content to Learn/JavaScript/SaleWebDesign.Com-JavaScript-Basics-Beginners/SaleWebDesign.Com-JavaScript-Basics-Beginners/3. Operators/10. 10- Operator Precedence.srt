When working with

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
complex expressions, one thing that you need to account for is the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
precedents of operators. Let me show you an example.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, let's declare x and set it to 2,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
plus 3 x 4. What do you think is the

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
result of this expression. Well, let's log this and have a look.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, we get 14. The reason for that

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is because the multiplication operator has higher

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
precedents so this expression is evaluated first, so 3

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
x 4 is 12, and then the result is added to 2.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, all these operators you have learned in this section, they have their own

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
precedents. It's really hard to memorize which operators have

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
higher precedents or lower precedents. So when working with complex expressions

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you can use parenthesis to determine how these

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
operators are applied. For example, here we can put parenthesis

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
around 2 plus 3, and this means this expression

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is evaluated first, so we get 5, and then the result

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is multiplied by 4. So now if we save the changes we get

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,433
20.
