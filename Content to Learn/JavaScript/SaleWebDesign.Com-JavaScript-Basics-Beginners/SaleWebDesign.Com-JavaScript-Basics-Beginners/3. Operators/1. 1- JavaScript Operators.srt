00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So you have learned how to declare

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
variables and constants, now let's take a look at operators.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In JavaScript we have different kinds of operators. We

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
use these operators along with our variables and constants to create

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
expressions. And with these expressions we can implement

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
logic and algorithms. So here are the different kinds of

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
operators in JavaScript. We have arithmetic

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
operators, assignment operators, comparison operators

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
logical operators, and bitwise operators. Over the next few

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
lectures, you're going to learn each of these in detail.
