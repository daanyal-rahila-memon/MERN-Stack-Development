In this

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
exercise, once again we're going to use a constructor function to create

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a post object. But this constructor object, is a little bit

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
different than the constructor function you wrote in an earlier exercise.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So here's the scenario. Imagine we're building a blogging

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
engine, the user is drafting a post, but they have not

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
published it yet, what do you think that constructor function should

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
look like? So spend a couple minutes on this exercise, when you're done

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
come back and continue watching.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Alright, let's start by creating this

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
constructor function, we're going to call that post, and note the

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
capitol P here, so what parameters do we need here?

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Obviously we need the title and the body and the

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
author, but we don't need the number of views, because the

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
first time we create a post, views should be set to zero, and

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
every time we view that post we increment that value. So views

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is not something that we want to pass here, we want to use a default value

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of zero, when initializing this post object.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The same is true for the comments property. For a new

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
post that has not been published yet, we don't have any comments

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so we don't want to add a comments parameter here. The same is true

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for the isLive property. We want to set this to

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
false. by default so there is really no need to add

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
an extra parameter in this function. So

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we should aim to have functions with fewer parameters. The more

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
parameters a function has, the harder it gets to use it, okay?

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So here, we're going to set this.title

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to the title argument, the same is true for the body,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
property and author.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, for the views, I'm going to initialize this

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to 0, similarly we're going to

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
initialize comments to an empty array, so

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in the future we can add new objects to this array, and then finally

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we set isLive to false. Now,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
instead of initializing this post object here,

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we're going to call our constructor function,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
pass the title, body, and author,

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and finally let's log this on the console.

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, we can see

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
author body and title properties are initialized based

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on the values that we passed here. But the author properties have default

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
values. So comments is initialized to an empty array, isLive

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is false, and views is 0.
