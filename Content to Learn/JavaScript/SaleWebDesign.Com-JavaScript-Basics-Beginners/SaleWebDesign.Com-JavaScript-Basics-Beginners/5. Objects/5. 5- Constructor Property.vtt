Every object

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in JavaScript has a property called constructor.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And that references the function that was used to construct

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or create that object. So here we have two objects

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
circle and another. Let's look at their constructor

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
property. So, here, on the console,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
another.constructor.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So as you see, this returns our circle function that we used to

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
create this object. Now let's look at circle

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
.constructor. What is this?

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, we can tell that this is a function, because here we have

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
this blue f. And as you can see the first letter of this function

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is uppercase. So this is a built in constructor

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
function in JavaScript, when we create an object using

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
object literal syntax, internally the JavaScript engine

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
uses this constructor function. Let me show you. So I'm going to

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
temporarily delete all this code, let's define

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
an object like this, when we use this syntax, object

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
literal, JavaScript will translate that to something like this.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let x equals new object.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Okay? So, the circle object

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we created and returned it from our factory function, and because we used

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the object literal syntax, internally it was created using

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
this object constructor function. In JavaScript we have

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a few other built in constructors, for example, we have

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
string for creating strings, but quite often

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we use string literals. So, single code,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or double code, or back tick. Using these literals

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is cleaner and simpler than using the constructor.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We also have boolean, but again we don't use this, we

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
either use true or false. So we refer to these as

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
boolean literals. We also have number,

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but instead we use number literals, like 1, 2,

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
3, whatever. So this is what I want you to take away,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Every object has a constructor property, and that references

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a function that was used to create that object.
