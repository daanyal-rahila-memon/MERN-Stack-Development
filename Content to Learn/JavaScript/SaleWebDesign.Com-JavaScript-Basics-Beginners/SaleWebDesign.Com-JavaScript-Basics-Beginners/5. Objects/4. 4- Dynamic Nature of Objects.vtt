00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One thing we need

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to understand about objects in JavaScript is that they are dynamic

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which means once you create them you can always add new properties

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or methods, or remove existing ones. So here we have a circle

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
object with a single property that is radius, we can add

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
another property like color set it to yellow

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
now when we log the circle on the console you can see we have

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
two properties, color and radius. Similarly, we

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
can add a new method here, circle.draw, we set it to

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
new function and now when we log this on the console

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we can see our circle object has three members, two properties,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
color and radius, and one method. We can

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
also delete existing properties or methods, so here before

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
logging the circle, we can use the delete operator, to

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
delete a member from a circle object. That member can be a property

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
method. So circle.color

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we can also delete the draw method, so circle.draw,

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
now save the changes, we can see now our circle object

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
has only the radius property that we added at the

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
time of creating this object. Now one thing some developers find confusing

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is that here we have used the const keyword,

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to define a new constant. However, you can see I have modified

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the circle object of either the property, and then remove that property.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So what kind of constant is that? Well, when we use constant

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
here, that means we cannot reassign this variable,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so this variable is more accurately a constant. So we cannot

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
reset circle to a new object. If we do that,

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we get this error. Assignment to constant variable.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So we cannot reassign this constant, but we

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can always change the circle object by adding

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
or removing properties.
