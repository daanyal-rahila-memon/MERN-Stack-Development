1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And finally

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the last exercise for this section. Here on Yelp.com

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we have these price range buttons. So we've got inexpensive

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
moderate, pricey, and so on. If we want to implement

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
this concept, using objects, what properties do you think

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
those objects should have, that's the four on this exercise.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I want you to create an array of objects each object is what we call

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a price range object. It's one of these objects here. Now here we

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
have 4 price range objects, in this exercise we can create

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
only 3 price range objects. Think about the properties

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that each object should have. So pause the video, spend a couple of minutes on this

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
exercise, and when you're done come back and see my solution.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright I'm going to create an array called price ranges

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in this array we're going to have three objects,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
each object should have 4 properties, one is the

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
label that we display to the user, like a dollar sign.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The second property is a tooltip

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so here when I hover my mouse over each button, you can see

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a tool tip. So for each price range object

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we need this tool tip property. Let's call this inexpensive.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now we need two more properties and with

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this we can determine the minimum and maximum price of a meal,

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
per person. We can call them

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
minPerPerson or maxPerPerson.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So for this object I'm assuming that the average price of a meal per

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
person falls between 0 to 10 dollars. And this is

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
important for filtering. Because if we are building an application like

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yelp, somewhere we need to store the list of restaurants. So,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we might have another array here,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
restaurants. In this array we're going to have restaurant objects,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and each restaurant object should have this property. Average

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
PerPerson. Let's say the average per person is 5 dollars.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now when it comes to filtering, let's imagine that the user

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
only wants to see inexpensive restaurants, so

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
this is the object that we're going to work with, and in this object we can see

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the price per person is between 0 to 10 dollars. Now

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we want to filter the list of restaurants and pull out

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
those where the average price per person is between

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
these values. So that's the whole point of having

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
these two properties, okay? Now similarly we can create two more

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
objects, we just need to change the value

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
of these properties. So here we have the moderate price range

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
let's say that's between 11 and 22 dollars, and

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
finally the last one is going to be expensive

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
with price per person from 21 dollars to

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
let's say 50 dollars. So I hope you successfully

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
completed this exercise, if not don't worry, there are a million

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
examples out there for you to practice. Whenever you're using an application,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
look at the features of that application, look at the concepts, and imagine

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
if you wanted to model one of those concepts, using an object

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
what properties would you put in that object?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The more you practice this, the easier it becomes. And that brings us to the end

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
of this section. I hope you enjoyed this section, and thank you for watching.
