Alright, here's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
your first exercise for this section. I want you to create an address object

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with three properties, street,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
city, and zip code.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When you do that, then create a function called

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
showAddress that takes an address object and displays all

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the properties of this object along with their value.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So pause the video, when you're done, come back and continue watching.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So now

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm going to create an address object, we can use the let or constant keyword.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In this case it doesn't really matter, here we're using the

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
object literal syntax to initialize this object, so we have

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the street property we set that to some value, it doesn't really matter

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
next is the city property, and finally

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
zipCode. Next,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we need to create this function, showAddress,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that takes an address object, and here to

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
enumerate the properties of this object, we're going to use the for

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in loop. So, let key in address

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
then we do a console.log

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of key, and address of key,

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so here we're using the bracket notation for the value of a given key.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And finally we call this function,

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
showAddress and pass our address object.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Save the changes, and here's the result.
