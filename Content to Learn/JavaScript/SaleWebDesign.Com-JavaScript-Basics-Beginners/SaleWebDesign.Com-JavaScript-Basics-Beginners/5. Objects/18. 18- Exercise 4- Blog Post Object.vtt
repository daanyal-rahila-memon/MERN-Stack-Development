In this

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
exercise I want you to create a blog post object with

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
these properties. title, body,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
author, views, which represents the number of

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
times this post has been viewed. Comments,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
now each comment should have a couple properties. Author

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and body. And finally, another property,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that each post should have is isLive. Now

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that can be either true or false. So once again you should

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
use the object literal syntax to create and initialize a

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
blog post. Give each property some value, the actual value doesn't

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
really matter. I just want you to get comfortable with the object literal syntax

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Alright here's a solution. So let's create a

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
post object, using the object literal syntax, we set the

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
title to a, body to b,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
author to c, so all these three

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
properties are strings. Now views should be a

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
number, we can set that to 10, comments,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
should be an array because we can have multiple comments, so we set that

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to an array, now each comment should have

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
two properties, so each comment should be an object. So

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
here once again we use the object literal syntax to initialize

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a comment object. We set the author to a

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and body to b. We can have another comment

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in this array. Let's duplicate that, different values

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and finally we should add

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the isLive property, so,

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
isLive set that to true.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And then let's do a console.log of post

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
inspect this on the console, so we can see

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the comments property is an array with two objects, if we spend

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
this you can see the properties of each object. We've got author

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.066
and body.
