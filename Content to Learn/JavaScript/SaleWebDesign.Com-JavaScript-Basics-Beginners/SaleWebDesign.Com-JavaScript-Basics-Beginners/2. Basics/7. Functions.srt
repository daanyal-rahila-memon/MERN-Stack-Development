00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the category

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of reference types, you have learned about objects and arrays. Now,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
let's take a look at functions. Functions are one of the fundamental

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
building blocks in JavaScript. A function is basically

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a set of statements that performs a task or calculates

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
a value. Let show you a couple examples. So I'm going to

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
declare a function using the function keyword. Now we need to give it

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
a name, let's call that greet. After that we need to add

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
parenthesis, that's part of the syntax for declaring functions.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then curly braces. Now what we have here,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
inside the curly braces is what we refer to as the body of

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
this function. And this is where we add all the statements to define

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
some kind of logic in our application. For example,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The logic for this function should be to display a message

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
on the console. So here we can add console.log

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello World.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now note that here we have a statement, so we terminate it with a

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
semi colon, but when we are declaring a function, we don't need to add

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
semi colon at the end, because we are not declaring it like a

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
variable like this. Okay? This is a function

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
declaration, right? So, now we have a function

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we can call this function like this. So we add the

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
name of the function, and parenthesis again, and then

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
semi colon to indicate that this is a statement. Save the

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
changes, now we have Hello World on the console. But that's pretty boring,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
what would we do with this? Let me show you how to make this more interesting.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Our functions can have inputs, and these inputs can change

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
how the function behaves. So, let's say

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
instead of displaying Hello World we want to display the name of the person

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
here. Like Hello Jon. So we can add

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
a variable here in between parenthesis,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we refer to tis variable as a parameter. So,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
this greet function has one parameter called name, and essentially

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
name is like a variable that is only meaningful

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
inside of this function. So inside of this function we can work with this name variable

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but it will not be accessible outside of this function.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now name is an input to this function. So instead of

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
displaying Hello World you can display Hello then add

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
a plus here to concatenate two strings.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, we can add name after. Now,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
when calling the greet function, we need to pass a value for the

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
name variable, or name parameter more accurately. So,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we can pass John here, now we refer to this

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
as an argument. So John is an argument

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to the greet function and name is a

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
parameter of the greet function it's one of the things that a lot of programmers

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
know. They don't know the difference between a parameter and an argument.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So a parameter is what we have here at the time of declaration,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
but the argument is the actual value of supply for that

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
parameter. Okay? Now, I save the changes,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so we have Hello John. Now we can reuse this function

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but with a different input. So, we can

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
change this line here and change John to Mary. Save the changes

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
now we have two different messages on the console.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now a function can have multiple parameters. So here we can have

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
separate parameters using a comma, so let's add another

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
parameter like lastName, now

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we can change our console.log add a space here,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and then display the lastName.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, when calling this greet function, we should pass

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
another argument for the last name. Well let's see what happens if we don't

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
do this. So I'm going to save the changes, see what we got

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hello John undefined. Because as I told you before

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that the fault value of variables in JavaScript is undefined.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So because we did not pass a value for the last name,

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
by default it's undefined. So I'm going to pass

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
another argument here, we separate them using comma

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
John Smith and we don't need this second call to the

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
greet function. Save the changes, now we have Hello

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,566
John Smith.
