00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One thing that separates JavaScript

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
from a lot of programming languages, is that JavaScript is a dynamic

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
language. What do I mean by dynamic? Well,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we have two types of programming languages. Static languages or

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
dynamic languages. In static languages, when we declare a

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
variable, the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in the future. In a dynamic language like JavaScript,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the type of a variable can change at run time. Let's see this

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in code. So back in the example from the last lecture we have declared

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
this name variable, and we have set that to a string, so

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the type of name is currently a string, but it can change in the future.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's take a look. So here in the console, we can execute some JavaScript

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
code, we have this type of operator,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and with that we can check the type of a variable. So after that

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we add the name of the variable. In this case the name variable

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So note that the type of name is a string. So,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
if you reassign name to a different value, like a number,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and check it's type,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
look, the type is now changed to a number, this is what we call

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a dynamic language, so unlike static languages the type of

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
these variables will be determined at runtime based on the values

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that we assigned to them. Now, let's take a look at a few more examples of the type

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of operator. And by the way, note that type of is

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
another reserved keyword, so we cannot have a variable called

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
type of. So, we can clear the console by

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
pressing control and L. So now let's take a look at

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the type of age, it's a number. Now if we change

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
age to a floating point number, and I know it doesn't make sense, but

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
let's just stick to this for example, 30.1,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and then look at type of age, it's still a

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
number. So in JavaScript, unlike other programming languages

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
we don't have two kinds of numbers, we don't have floating point numbers

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and integers, all numbers are of type number.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, let's look at the type of is approved, it's a

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
boolean as I told you before, what about the first name, let's have a

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
look. Type of, first name. It's undefined.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And that's funny, because the value of this variable is undefined

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
but it's type is also undefined. What does this mean?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, earlier I told you that we had two categories of types,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
we have primitives or value types, and reference types.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In the primitive types category, we have strings, numbers,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
booleans undefined and null. So undefined

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is actually a type, but it's also a value.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In this example, because we have set first name,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to undefined as a value it's type is also

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
undefined, okay? But what about selected color.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's have a look, so type of selected color.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The type of this variable is an object.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is an object? That's a topic for the next lecture.
