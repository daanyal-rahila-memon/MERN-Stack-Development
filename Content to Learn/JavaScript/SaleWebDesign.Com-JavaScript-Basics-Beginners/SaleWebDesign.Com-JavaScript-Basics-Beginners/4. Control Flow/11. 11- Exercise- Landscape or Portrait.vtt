Here is another

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
exercise. I want you to implement this function.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Function isLandscape, it takes two parameters,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
width, and height of an image, and returns true

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if the image is landscape, which means width is greater than

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
height, otherwise it returns false. Now you may think this

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is similar to the exercise in the last lecture, in fact it is, but I want you to

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
do this exercise because I'm going to give you a simple and affective tip to

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
write better code. So pause the video, do the exercise, and then come back

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and continue watching.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Alright, so similar to the last lecture, we can start

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with a simple if and else. So if width is greater than

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
height, you want to return true, otherwise we want to return

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
false. But I told you that in this case we

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
can use the conditional operator, so,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we add the condition if width is greater than height,

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we can return true, otherwise we'll return false.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And here's our return statement, right? So here's the implementation

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of this function, however code like this looks very

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
amateurish. You don't want to return true or false

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
explicitly. This is very ugly. Why? Well, let me show you.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We can completely delete this part here

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and simply return the value

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of this expression. So if width is greater than

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
height, this expression will be evaluated to true. So,

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you will simply return true. Otherwise, if width

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is less than height, this expression will evaluate to false, sun will

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
return false. So there is really no need to explicitly return

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
true and false here, that's a pour way of writing code.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, now we have this function, let's test

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it. We can do a console.log, simply call this

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
function here isLandscape, I'm going to pass these dimensions

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
800 by 600. So we expect true on the

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
console. Save the changes, here's true, beautiful,

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
now let's change the width to let's say 300. Now we have

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a vertical image. Save. So we get false.
