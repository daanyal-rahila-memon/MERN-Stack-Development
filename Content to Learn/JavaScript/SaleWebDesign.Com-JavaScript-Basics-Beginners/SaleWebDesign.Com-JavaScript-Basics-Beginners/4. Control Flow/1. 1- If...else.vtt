00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the last section you learned about

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
expressions and operators. In this section we're going to use these expressions

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and operators along with conditional statements

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to implement interactivity in our applications. In JavaScript

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we have two types of conditional statements, we have

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if and else, and switch and case. You're going to learn about if and else

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in this lecture, and we'll look at switch and case in the next lecture.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So imagine in our application we're going to get the current hour

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and depending on it's value, we're going to greet the user with a different message

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so if the hour is between

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
let's say 6am and 12pm, you

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
display something like good morning. Similarly, if

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it is between 12pm and 6pm we're going to display

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
good afternoon. Otherwise we're going to display

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
good evening. So we want to have some logic like this in our application.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That's where we use if and else. So we start with

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the if, then we add parenthesis. And

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in between these parenthesis, we add a condition. If this

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
condition evaluates to true, the statement we put

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
after will be executed. Now if you have multiple statements,

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we need to put them in between these curly

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
braces. We refer to these as a block of code.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Okay? Now optionally, we can have another condition

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so we write else if once again parenthesis,

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
anotherCondition. Now, if this

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
condition is true, then this other statement will be executed

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and similarly, if we have multiple statements, we need to surround them with

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
curly braces. Like this. Also note that

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
as a convention, when we want to define a block of code,

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we put the first curly brace on the same line, not here,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that's kind of ugly in JavaScript, so take that into account,

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
now back to our if and else, we could have yet another

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
condition like this, yet another condition, we could have as many conditions

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as we want, there is no limitation. And once again here

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we have 1 or more statements, now optionally if none

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of these conditions evaluate to true, we could use else

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to execute 1 or more other statements.

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So this is the basic structure. Now,

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we want to get this logic and map it into this structure.

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's very easy. So let's start with our first condition.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If hour is between 6am and 12 pm, so that's the

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
condition, and the statement we want to execute is good morning,

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
okay? So I'm going to declare a variable here,

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
hour and set it to 10, now in a real world application we want to

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
read the current hour. For now, let's now worry about getting the current time and

46
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
hard code this number here, 10. So,

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we want to compare the value of hour with these

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
two numbers. Now for simplicity, let's go with 24 hour time format

49
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so we want to see if hour is greater than

50
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or equal to 6, and

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
hour is less than 12. You learned this in the last section, right?

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So here we're using these comparison operators,

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we have two expressions, here's the first one, here's the second one,

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and we're applying the logical and in between them.

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, if both these expressions evaluate to true, than the result

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
of this expression will also be true. Now let's add the statement.

57
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You want to display good morning.

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And of course we need to terminate this statement with a

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
semi colon. Now here's my suggestion for you. If you want to master JavaScript

60
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
pause the video now and continue implementing this logic

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
using if and else then come back continue watching and see my

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
solution.

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Alright let's continue. Here's a second condition. You want

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to check to see if hour is between 12 and 18. So,

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
very easy. If hour is greater than or

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
equal to 12, and it's less than

67
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
18. We want to display good afternoon. So

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
console.log good afternoon.

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now in this example, we don't need this other else if

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because otherwise we want to display good evening. So let's delete

71
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
this, otherwise we do a console.log

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of good evening. Now in this

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
example, because we're dealing with a single statement

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
these curly braces are getting in the way and creating noise in the code.

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So it's better to get rid of them and simplify the code

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
here's another pair, okay, that's better.

77
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Save the changes, we get good morning here, if I change the

78
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
hour to 13, we get good afternoon, and if

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I change this to 20, we get good evening.

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So this is all about if and else. In the next lecture, you're going to learn about

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.533
switch and case.
