00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So as I told you in the last

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
lecture, starting from ecma script 6, or ES6,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we have a new way to iterate over a raise and that is

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
using the for of loop. It's very similar to the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
for in loop but instead of the in keyword we use the of keyword.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So here's an example, for let,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
color of colors,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you can simply log this color on the console.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can see with this new for loop, we don't have to deal with

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
this index. We don't have to access this element

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
at the given index. So in each iteration this

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
color which is our loop variable will hold one of the items in this array.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So when I save the changes you see red

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
green and blue. So I'm going to delete this for

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in loop, bring the colors array down to

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
summarize everything. So we use the for in loop

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to iterate over the properties of an object and

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the for of loop to iterate over the elements or items

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,033
in an array.
