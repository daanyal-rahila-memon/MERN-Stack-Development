When writing loops

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
something that you need to be aware of is what we call an infinite loop.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So an infinite loop as the name implies, executes

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
infinitely or forever. So if you accidentally create one of these

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
loops, you're going to crash your browser or your computer. Let me show you an example.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So here I'm going to declare a variable, set it

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to 0, put it in a while loop, so as long as

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
i is less than 5, we're going to do a console.log,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of i, now here technically we should increment

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
i, but if you forget to do so, you end up creating an

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
infinite loop, because in the first iteration, i is 0.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And it's less than 5, so we'll display an i on the console.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, in the second iteration i is still 0, and less than 5.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So this loop could run forever. So I'm going to save the changes,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
now on the console, this number you see before 0

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is the number of times you're displaying 0 on the console,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so you can see this number is increasing rapidly

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so far we have displayed 0, more than 35 hundred times.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And if you look at the browser, you can see this spinner going forever.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So the only way to get rid of this is to close this window,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or if this doesn't work, you'll have to force quit

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Chrome. So this is

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
1 example of an infinite loop. Here's another example

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
while true. Again, this loop is going to run forever.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it's an infinite loop. And by the way, infinite loops are not

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
limited to while loops, we can create an infinite

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
do while loop, so do while

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
true. Or similar to the last example, maybe we'll

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
create a loop variable like 0 and then

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
have a condition like x is less than 5, but we forget to

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
increment x here. We can also create

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
an infinite for loop. So, for

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
let i equal to 0, as long as i is greater than

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
0, i ++, again with the condition that we have

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
placed here this loop is going run forever, or maybe we

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
have the right condition, like i is less than 10, but we forget

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to add the third part. So we don't increment i, and this is

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
exactly like this while loop that we had earlier.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Without incrementing i. So be aware of the infinite loops,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
avoid them, because they can crash your browser or your computer.
