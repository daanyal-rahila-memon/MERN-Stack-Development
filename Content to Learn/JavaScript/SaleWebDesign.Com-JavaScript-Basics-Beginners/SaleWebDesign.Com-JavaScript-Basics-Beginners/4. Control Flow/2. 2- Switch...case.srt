1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, now let's take

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
a look at switch and case. So let's start by declaring

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a variable called roll. Let's imagine this represents

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the role of the current user. Now we want to see

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is a guest, or a moderator or an admin. We can

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
easily implement this logic, using a bunch of if and else statements.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But there is another way, using switch and case. So let's

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
take a look. We start with this switch statement, we add

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
parenthesis, but instead of adding a condition here,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we add a variable, in this case we're going to add the role

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
variable. Now we add curly braces,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then we add one or more case statements, each case statement

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is used to compare the value of this variable with something.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, here's our first case. If

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
this role equals guest, so I'm comparing the

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
value of role with guest, now we add colon,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then after that we add one or more statements. So,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
we can do a console.log guest user.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Like this. Now here we need to add a

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
break statement. So we jump out of this switch block.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Otherwise the other statements here will be executed, let me show you.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, we need to add another case statement. If

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this user is a moderator, we want to display

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
console.log Moderator

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
user once again we need to add the break, so

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in this case, if I don't add this break statement here,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the role equals guest, both

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
these console.log statements will be executed. That's why we need to

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
add a break to jump out of this switch block, right?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, we can have as many case statements here

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
there is no limitation. Optionally, if none of these

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
cases are matched, we can have a default

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
statement and execute 1 or more

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
statements so console.log, Unknown,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
User. Or more accurately, unknown role.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now here for the default statement we don't need a break, because

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
at this point the control will automatically get out of this switch block.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alright, so, let's save the changes and see what we get on the console.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Save. We get unknown user, because I have

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that initialized role, so it's default value is undefined and it doesn't

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
match any of these case statements. Now if I change

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
this to guest save the changes,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
we get guest user, and similarly if I change moderator

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
we get the moderator user message. So here's the takeaway.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With switch and case, we can compare the value of a variable,

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
against a bunch of other values. Now they don't have

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to be string, they can be numbers or even booleans. But using booleans here

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is less common. Because if you want to compare the value of a variable with true

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
or false, it makes more sense to use an if statement.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now just to let you know we can implement this exact logic

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
using if and else statements. Let me show you.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, if role equals

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
guest, note that I'm using strip equality here, so

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
triple equal signs, and that means we're checking the type and value

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
of this variable against what we have on the right side.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, if role is guest we want to do a console.log of

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
guest or guest user. Else if

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
role equals moderator then then we're going to do

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
a console.log of moderator

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
finally else if the role is something else

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we want to display unknown

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
user. Now compare these two implementations

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you can see implement in this logic with if and else

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is cleaner and shorter, we don't have all these break statements or

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
default, or these curly braces, these are extra

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
noise in the code. So it doesn't mean you should never use switch and case,

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
well it depends who you ask. I personally tend to use if and else more often,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
switch and case are kind of outdated, they look a little bit ugly, in my

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
personal opinion. But there is nothing terribly wrong with them, sometimes they are more

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
explicit. It comes back to your personal preference.
