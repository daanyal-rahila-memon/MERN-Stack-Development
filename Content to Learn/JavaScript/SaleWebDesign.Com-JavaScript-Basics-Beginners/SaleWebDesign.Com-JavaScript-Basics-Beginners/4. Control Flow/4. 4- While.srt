00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the last lecture,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we wrote this for loop to display all the odd numbers

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
between 0 and 5. And in this lecture, I'm going to show you how to

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
implement the same logic by using a while loop. Now one

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
key difference between a y loop and a for loop is that in for loops

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the loop variable is part of the loop variable itself.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But in y loops, you have to declare this y variable externally. Let me show

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you what I mean. So we start with declaring

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a variable like i and set it to 0. Note that this

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
i we have here is different from the i we have in this for loop,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because this variable is only meaningful and accessible

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
inside of this for loop. This is called scope, and I'm going to talk about

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it later in the course, all I want you to know is that these two

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
variables are completely different, even though their names are the same.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, we have our loop variable initialized to 0.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next we add a while statement,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
in parenthesis we need to add our condition. What is the condition

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
here? That is i less than or equal

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to 5. So I'm going to add that here. Next,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we need to add our statements. So what is the statement that

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we want to repeat, here's the statement, we want to display

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the odd numbers, so we add that here as well,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and finally, at the end of this while block we need

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to increment i. So this is a direct translation

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of this for loop into a y loop.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So this is what happens when we execute this code. Initially I

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is 0, now in the y loop, first this condition

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is evaluated, if this condition is true, then the

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
body of the y loop will be executed. Again, in the next iteration

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the condition is evaluated again, if it's true, the

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
statements in the y block will be executed, otherwise the while block

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
will terminate. In the next lecture we're going to look at another kind of

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
loops in JavaScript.
