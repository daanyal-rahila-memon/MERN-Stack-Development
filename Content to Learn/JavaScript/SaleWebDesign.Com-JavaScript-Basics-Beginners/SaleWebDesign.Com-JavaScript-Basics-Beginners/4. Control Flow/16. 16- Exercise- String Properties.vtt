00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright here's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
another simple but great exercise, your job is to create a function

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
called show properties. We pass an object here. And this function

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
should display all the properties of this object that are

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of type string. Let me give you an example. So on the

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
top, I'm going to define an object,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
like movie, here's the object literal syntax to initialize this,

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so here we're gonna add a few properties like title,

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
set it to a simple string, the value doesn't really matter, a is enough.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Release here, we set it to a number, like 2018.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Rating, again, a number, and then director

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we set it to another string. Now if we call

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
function showProperties, we pass this movie object

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
see what we get. We see the

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
string properties of our movie object, so title is a and director is

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
b. So pause the video, do the exercise

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and when you're done come back and continue watching.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Alright here we need to use the for in loop

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to iterate over the properties of this object. So,

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for let key in object

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so in each iteration this key will hold

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the name of one of these properties. Let's have a quick look here, console.log

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of key. So we get title, release

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Year and so on. Now we need to get the value of each of these properties

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then check the type of that value. If the type is a string

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
then we'll display the property and it's value.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So to get the value of this property we use the bracket notation, so

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
object of key. Now to check the type of this value

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
use the typeof operator and then we put this in an

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
if statement. So if the type of object

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of key equals string, then

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we simply display the

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
key as well as object of

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
key, save the changes.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We only get the title and director properties. That's

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
something I need to emphasize here, you might be wondering why I didn't

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
use curly braces here. Because we have two lines

38
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
under this 4 statement. Well accurately we only have

39
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
single statement under this for statement so this

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
console.log is a single statement that belongs to our if statement.

41
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So here we don't need curly braces because we're dealing with a

42
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
single statement under the for statement. But if you prefer

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to put the curly braces here, that's perfectly fine. So let me show you

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
it looks like this. It's more of a personal preference.
